19401 United States United States December 22, 2022WARNING LETTER 


Dear 
Mr. Poole: The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions to 
the FDA and our inspection records, and determined that JP 
& SN Enterprises Inc. d/b/a eCigs International manufactures and distributes 
e-liquid products for commercial distribution in the United States, and 
that the e-liquid products are manufactured and offered for sale 
or distribution to customers in the United States. Under section 
201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C 
Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products 
because they are made or derived from tobacco or contain 
nicotine from any source, and intended for human consumption. Certain 
tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction 
under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1, and are required to 
be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act. 
Please be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President 
signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA’s 
jurisdiction to products “containing nicotine from any source,” not just 
nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public 
Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this 
legislation expanded the definition of “tobacco product” under section 201(rr) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include 
products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including e-liquid 
products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance 
with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more 
information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14. Generally, to be legally marketed in 
the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” 
to have a premarket authorization in effect. A “new tobacco 
product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed 
in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or 
any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 
15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 
§ 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required 
for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of 
the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an 
order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco 
product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the 
manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered 
by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by 
FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 387e(j)(3)). A New Tobacco Product Without Required Marketing Authorization 
Is Adulterated and Misbranded FDA has determined that you manufacture, 
sell, and/or distribute to customers in the United States ZEN 
JUICE Absalom e-liquid product without a marketing authorization order. The 
e-liquid product listed above is a new tobacco product because 
it was not commercially marketed in the United States as 
of February 15, 2007. This product does not have an 
FDA marketing authorization order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of 
the FD&C Act and is not otherwise exempt from the 
marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, this product is adulterated under section 
902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In 
addition, it is misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other 
information respecting this product was not provided as required by 
section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. The doing of any 
act with respect to a tobacco product while such article 
is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which 
results in such product being adulterated or misbranded is a 
prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, to the extent that a report 
was required under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, the 
failure to provide such report is a prohibited act under 
section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)). 
Conclusion and Requested Actions FDA has not received an application 
from your firm requesting marketing authorization for the product listed 
in this Warning Letter. This product and any other new 
tobacco product on the market without the statutorily required premarket 
authorization are adulterated and misbranded and are subject to enforcement 
action at FDA’s discretion. It is your responsibility to ensure 
that all of your tobacco products comply with each applicable 
provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure 
to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
§ 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products 
including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, 
and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not 
limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this 
Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of 
section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco 
products offered for import into the United States that appear 
to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused 
admission. The violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily 
constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to 
address any violations that are referenced above, as well as 
violations that are the same as or similar to the 
ones stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring 
your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act. Please 
submit a written response to this letter within 15 working 
days from the date of receipt describing your actions to 
address any violations and bring your products into compliance, including 
the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or 
distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining 
compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that your 
products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include 
your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This 
letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with 
an opportunity to address them. You can find the FD&C 
Act through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov. Please note 
your reference number, ER2200755, in your response and direct your 
response to the following address: DPAL-WL Response, Office of Compliance

Dear 
Mr. Heinrichs: The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions to 
the FDA and our inspection records, and determined that Tiger 
Vapes manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for commercial distribution in 
the United States, and that the e-liquid products are manufactured 
and offered for sale or distribution to customers in the 
United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug,

order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless 
(1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under 
section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) 
and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent

Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded FDA has determined that 
you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to customers in the United 
States Grape Berries e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order. 
The e-liquid products listed above are new tobacco products because 
they were not commercially marketed in the United States as

authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, 
they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information 
respecting these products was not provided as required by section 
905(j) of the FD&C Act. The doing of any act 
with respect to a tobacco product while such article is 
held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results 
in such product being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited

required under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure 
to provide such report is a prohibited act under section

34953 Tuzla/İstanbul Turkey United States Warning Letter 320-23-11 February 13, 
2023 


Dear Ms. Erdemir: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) inspected your drug manufacturing facility, Delta Kozmetik Sanayi Ve 
Ticaret-Selim Yesil, FEI 3010166780, at Bolgesi Aydinli Sb Mahallesi, 6 
12 Istanbul Endustri Veticaret Serbest, Sokak Tuzla, Istanbul, from September 
12 to September 16, 2022. This warning letter summarizes significant 
violations of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished 
pharmaceuticals. See Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 
210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211). Because 
your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or 
holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are 
adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). 
We reviewed your October 7, 2022 response to our Form 
FDA 483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent 
correspondence. Your response is inadequate because it did not provide 
sufficient detail or evidence of corrective actions to bring your 
operations into compliance with CGMP. During our inspection, our investigator 
observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following. 
1. Your firm failed to test samples of each component 
for identity and conformity with all appropriate written specifications for 
purity, strength, and quality. Your firm also failed to validate 
and establish the reliability of your component supplier’s test analyses 
at appropriate intervals (21 CFR 211.84(d)(1) and 211.84(d)(2)). You failed 
to adequately test your incoming components for identity before using 
the components to manufacture your over-the-counter (OTC) drug products. You 
also failed to adequately qualify your suppliers, as you have 
not validated the test results of your suppliers’ analyses and 
instead relied on your suppliers’ responses to your vendor questionnaire. 
Additionally, you relied on certificates of analyses (COAs) from these 
unqualified suppliers for specifications such as purity, strength, and quality. 
By not analyzing your components for identity, purity, strength, and 
quality, you failed to ensure that your incoming components meet 
appropriate specifications. In response to this letter, provide: 2. Your 
firm failed to establish adequate written procedures for production and 
process control designed to assure that the drug products you 
manufacture have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they purport 
or are represented to possess (21 CFR 211.100(a)). Your firm 
has not established that your processes used to manufacture your 
drug products are appropriately validated. You failed to conduct process 
validation studies for numerous drug products you manufactured and distributed 
to the United States, and the process validation studies that 
you performed were inadequate because they lacked appropriate testing (e.g., 
assay testing of active ingredients) on the finished drug products. 
Further, you also lacked appropriate qualification of equipment used to 
manufacture your drug products. Process validation evaluates the soundness of 
design and state of control of a process throughout its 
lifecycle. Each significant stage of a manufacturing process must be 
designed appropriately and assure the quality of raw material inputs, 
in-process materials, and finished drugs. Process qualification studies determine whether 
an initial state of control has been established. Successful process 
qualification studies are necessary before commercial distribution. Thereafter, ongoing vigilant 
oversight of process performance and product quality is necessary to 
ensure you maintain a stable manufacturing operation throughout the product 
lifecycle. See FDA’s guidance document Process Validation: General Principles and 
Practices for general principles and approaches that FDA considers appropriate 
elements of process validation at https://www.fda.gov/media/71021/download. In response to this 
letter, provide: 3. Your firm failed to establish and follow 
an adequate written testing program designed to assess the stability 
characteristics of drug products and to use results of stability 
testing to determine appropriate storage conditions and expiration dates (21 
CFR 211.166(a)). You failed to demonstrate that you established and 
followed an adequate stability program to determine appropriate storage conditions 
and expiration dates of drug products manufactured at your facility. 
For example, your stability program lacked appropriate testing of your 
drug products, including testing of active ingredients, impurities, and other 
degradation products. Without appropriate stability studies, you lack scientific evidence 
to support whether your drug products meet established specifications and 
retain their quality attributes through their expiry. In response to 
this letter, provide: o Stability indicating methods. o Stability studies 
for each drug product in its marketed container-closure system before 
distribution is permitted. o An ongoing program in which representative 
batches of each product are added each year to the 
program to determine if the shelf-life claim remains valid. o 
Detailed definition of the specific attributes to be tested at 
each station (timepoint). CGMP Consultant Recommended Based upon the nature 
of the violations we identified at your firm, you should 
engage a consultant qualified as set forth in 21 CFR 
211.34 to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements and 
in response to this Warning Letter. The qualified consultant should 
also perform a comprehensive audit of your entire operation for 
CGMP compliance and evaluate the completion and efficacy of your 
CAPA before you pursue resolution of your firm’s compliance status 
with FDA. Your use of a consultant does not relieve 
your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive 
management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws 
to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance. Conclusion The violations cited in 
this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list 
of violations that exist at your facility. You are responsible 
for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and 
for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. 
FDA placed your firm on Import Alert 66-40 on January 
11, 2023. In addition, FDA previously placed your firm on 
Import Alert 66-78 on May 17, 2021, due to violative 
sampling results of your (b)(4) drug product. Correct any violations 
promptly. FDA may withhold approval of new applications or supplements 
listing your firm as a drug manufacturer until any violations 
are completely addressed and we confirm your compliance with CGMP. 
We may re-inspect to verify that you have completed corrective 
actions to any violations. Failure to address any violations may 
also result in the FDA continuing to refuse admission of 
articles manufactured at Delta Kozmetik Sanayi Ve Ticaret-Selim Yesil, Bolgesi 
Aydinli Sb Mahallesi, 6 12 Istanbul Endustri Veticaret Serbest, Sokak 
Tuzla, Istanbul, into the United States under section 801(a)(3) of 
the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3). Articles under this authority 
that appear to be adulterated may be detained or refused 
admission, in that the methods and controls used in their 
manufacture do not appear to conform to CGMP within the 
meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
351(a)(2)(B). This letter notifies you of our findings and provides 
you an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. After you 
receive this letter, respond to this office in writing within 
15 working days. Specify what you have done to address 
any violations and to prevent their recurrence. In response to 
this letter, you may provide additional information for our consideration 
as we continue to assess your activities and practices. If 
you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state 
your reasons for delay and your schedule for completion. Send 
your electronic reply to CDER-OC-OMQ-Communications@fda.hhs.gov. Identify your response with FEI 
3010166780 and ATTN: Bryce Hammer.

Springs, FL 34134 United States United States 


Dear Mr. Hannon: 
The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions to the FDA 
and our inspection records, and determined that Vape King Inc. 
manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for commercial distribution in the 
United States, and that the e-liquid products are manufactured and 
offered for sale or distribution to customers in the United 
States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products 
are tobacco products because they are made or derived from 
tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including 
e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 
C.F.R. § 1100.1. Therefore, these products are required to be 
in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act. Please 
be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional 
products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories 
to these newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation 
under the FD&C Act. These products include, but are not 
limited to, electronic nicotine delivery systems (including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), 
cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products 
To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco 
Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco 
Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. 
Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. The FD&C 
Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization 
in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product 
that was not commercially marketed in the United States as 
of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that 
was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of 
the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing 
authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product 
unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report 
under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially 
equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the 
FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under 
section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) 
and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements 
of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)). A New Tobacco 
Product Without Required Marketing Authorization Is Adulterated and Misbranded FDA 
has determined that you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to customers 
in the United States Vape King Blue Raspberry 3mg e-liquid 
product without a marketing authorization order. The tobacco product listed 
above is a new tobacco product because it was not 
commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 
2007. This product does not have an FDA marketing authorization 
order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act 
and is not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. 
Therefore, this product is adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, it is 
misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting this 
product was not provided as required by section 905(j) of 
the FD&C Act. The doing of any act with respect 
to a tobacco product while such article is held for 
sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such 
product being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited act under 
section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). 
Additionally, to the extent that a report was required under 
section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure to provide 
such report is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)). Conclusion and Requested 
Actions All new tobacco products on the market without the 
statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject 
to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. Products for which no 
application is pending, including, for example, those with a Marketing 
Denial Order and those for which no application was submitted, 
are among our highest enforcement priorities. For information on how 
FDA intends to prioritize enforcement resources with regard to the 
marketing of certain adulterated and misbranded ENDS and other deemed 
new tobacco products, please refer to the FDA’s guidance titled 
Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) and Other 
Deemed Products on the Market Without Premarket Authorization, available at 
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market. It is your responsibility to ensure that all of 
your tobacco products comply with each applicable provision of the 
FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any 
violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et 
seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products including the tobacco 
regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may 
lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil 
money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does 
not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of 
the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for 
import into the United States that appear to be adulterated 
and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission. The violations 
discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive 
list. You should take prompt action to address any violations 
that are referenced above, as well as violations that are 
the same as or similar to the ones stated above, 
and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products 
into compliance with the FD&C Act. Please submit a written 
response to this letter within 15 working days from the 
date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations 
and bring your products into compliance, including the dates on 
which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these 
tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the 
FD&C Act. If you believe that your products are not 
in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and 
any supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you 
of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to 
address them. You can find the FD&C Act through links 
on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov. Please note your reference number,

Additionally, to the extent that a report was required under

0E7 Canada United States Warning Letter 320-23-05 November 28, 2022 



Dear Mr. Fraser: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
inspected your drug manufacturing facility, AG Hair Limited, FEI 3002892007, 
at 14 King Edward Street, Coquitlam from June 20 to 
24, 2022. This warning letter summarizes significant violations of Current 
Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 
21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 
(21 CFR parts 210 and 211). Because your methods, facilities, 
or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not 
conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the 
meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). We reviewed your 
July 15, 2022, response to our Form FDA 483 in 
detail. Your response is inadequate because it did not provide 
sufficient detail or evidence of corrective actions to bring your 
operations into compliance with CGMP. During our inspection, our investigator 
observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following. 
1. Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate any unexplained discrepancy 
or failure of a batch or any of its components 
to meet any of its specifications, whether or not the 
batch has already been distributed (21 CFR 211.192). Your firm 
failed to adequately investigate a sample taken from your non-circulating, 
on-demand (b)(4) system. The sample was taken prior to manufacturing 
your (b)(4) drug product, lot (b)(4). The sample yielded an 
elevated bioburden count of (b)(4) CFU/mL (specification: not more than 
(b)(4) CFU/mL). You released the (b)(4) drug product without conducting 
a comprehensive investigation, including to document the root cause determination, 
and speciation and product impact assessment based on the recovered 
microorganisms. Additionally, your firm failed to adequately investigate a customer 
complaint of (b)(4) irritation from the use of your (b)(4), 
lot (b)(4). Your investigation consisted of conducting a “panel test” 
involving four “participants,” who were all your employees, who used 
the (b)(4)1. You then determined that further investigation was not 
required after concluding that your employees exhibited no allergic reactions 
after using the (b)(4). No additional testing or evaluation of 
the lot was conducted. In your response, you committed to 
updating standard operating procedures (SOPs) for managing complaints and deviations. 
Your response is inadequate. You failed to perform a retrospective 
review of previous investigations (including those associated with at least 
two lots of your (b)(4)) to ensure they were comprehensive 
and that adequate risk assessments were conducted. Further, you have 
not addressed how you will remediate your investigation system to 
determine the appropriate root cause, identify and implement appropriate corrective 
action and preventive action (CAPA) to prevent recurrence, and measure 
CAPA effectiveness. Inadequate investigations may result in not identifying or 
mitigating the root causes of non-conformances and does not ensure 
consistent production of safe and effective drugs. For more information 
about handling failing, OOS, out-of-trend, or other unexpected analytical results 
and documentation of your investigations, see FDA’s guidance document https://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidances/ucm070287.pdf. 
In response to this letter, provide: 2. Your firm failed 
to establish laboratory controls that include scientifically sound and appropriate 
specifications, standards, sampling plans, and test procedures designed to assure 
that components, drug product containers, closures, in-process materials, labeling, and 
drug products conform to appropriate standards of identity, strength, quality, 
and purity (21 CFR 211.160(b)). Your firm failed to establish 
adequate laboratory controls including microbiological testing and specifications for all 
of your non-sterile drug products. For example, your firm failed 
to conduct microbiological testing of your Hands Free Clean Hand 
Sanitizer Gel drug product prior to release. Additionally, while microbiological 
testing is conducted on your (b)(4) drug product prior to 
release; your standard plate count specification is not appropriate for 
the intended use of the product. In your response, you 
committed to updating your microbiological test procedures and specifications. Your 
response is inadequate. You failed to commit to a plan 
to ensure your previously distributed drug products meet your updated 
microbiological test procedures and specifications. Your response did not include 
what actions you will take if your previously distributed drug 
products does not meet your updated microbiological test procedures and 
specifications. In response to this letter, provide: 3. Your firm 
failed to test samples of each component for identity and 
conformity with all appropriate written specifications for purity, strength, and 
quality (21 CFR 211.84(d)(1) and 211.84(d)(2)). You failed to perform 
adequate identity testing for each component lot used in the 
production of your hand sanitizer drug products, including ethanol, your 
active pharmaceutical ingredient. Additionally, your active pharmaceutical ingredient, ethanol, is 
not tested for methanol content, and your procedures did not 
ensure that you test glycerin for presence of diethylene glycol 
(DEG). In your response, you committed to updating component testing 
procedures and specifications. Your response is inadequate. You failed to 
provide a detailed plan to ensure that previously distributed drug 
products were manufactured with incoming components that meet your updated 
identity and impurity testing requirements. Component testing is fundamental to 
quality. Without adequate testing, you do not have scientific evidence 
that your incoming components conform to appropriate specifications before use 
in the manufacture of drug products. Products Containing Ethanol You 
manufacture multiple drugs that contain ethanol. The use of ethanol 
contaminated with methanol has resulted in various lethal poisoning incidents 
in humans worldwide. See FDA’s guidance document Policy for Testing 
of Alcohol (Ethanol) and Isopropyl Alcohol for Methanol, Including During 
the Public Health Emergency (COVID-19) to help you meet the 
CGMP requirements when manufacturing drugs containing ethanol at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/policytesting-alcohol-ethanol-and-isopropyl-alcohol-methanol-including-during-public-health. Products 
Contain Glycerin You manufacture products that contain glycerin. The use 
of glycerin contaminated with diethylene glycol (DEG) has resulted in 
various lethal poisoning incidents in humans worldwide. See FDA’s guidance 
document Testing of Glycerin for Diethylene Glycol to help you 
meet the CGMP requirements when manufacturing drugs containing glycerin at 
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/testingglycerin-diethylene-glycol. In response to this letter, provide: Drug Production Ceased 
We acknowledge your commitment to cease production of hand sanitizer 
drugs for the U.S. market. As of the date of 
this letter, your hand sanitizer drug products continue to be 
actively listed with the FDA. Additionally, shipments of your hand 
sanitizer drug products have entered the United States after you 
informed FDA of your decision to cease manufacturing these drug 
products. FDA has since placed your firm on Import Alert 
66-40. In response to this letter, clarify whether you intend 
to cease manufacturing and distribution of your hand sanitizer drug 
products to the United States. If your intent is to 
cease manufacturing and distribution of these products, delist all hand 
sanitizer drug products previously listed with FDA. CGMP Consultant Recommended 
Based upon the nature of the violations we identified at 
your firm, you should engage a consultant qualified as set 
forth in 21 CFR 211.34 to assist your firm in 
meeting CGMP requirements. The qualified consultant should also perform a 
comprehensive audit of your entire operation for CGMP compliance and 
evaluate the completion and efficacy of your corrective actions and 
preventive actions before you pursue resolution of your firm’s compliance 
status with FDA. Your use of a consultant does not 
relieve your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s 
executive management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic 
flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance. Conclusion The violations cited 
in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive 
list of violations that exist at your facility. You are 
responsible for investigating and determining the causes of these violations 
and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other 
violations. FDA placed your firm on Import Alert 66-40 on 
October 28, 2022. Correct any violations promptly. FDA may withhold 
approval of new applications or supplements listing your firm as 
a drug manufacturer until any violations are completely addressed and 
we confirm your compliance with CGMP. We may re-inspect to 
verify that you have completed corrective actions to any violations. 
Failure to address any violations may also result in the 
FDA continuing to refuse admission of articles manufactured at AG 
Hair Limited, 14 King Edward Street, Coquitlam into the United 
States under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
381(a)(3). Articles under this authority that appear to be adulterated 
may be detained or refused admission, in that the methods 
and controls used in their manufacture do not appear to 
conform to CGMP within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of 
the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). This letter notifies you 
of our findings and provides you an opportunity to address 
the above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, respond to 
this office in writing within 15 working days. Specify what 
you have done to address any violations and to prevent 
their recurrence. In response to this letter, you may provide 
additional information for our consideration as we continue to assess 
your activities and practices. If you cannot complete corrective actions 
within 15 working days, state your reasons for delay and 
your schedule for completion. Send your electronic reply to CDER-OC-OMQ-Communications@fda.hhs.gov. 
Identify your response with FEI 3002892007 and ATTN: Rory Geyer.

(E) Mumbai 400099 Maharashtra India United States Warning Letter 320-23-04 
November 22, 2022 


Dear Mr. Saldanha: The U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your drug manufacturing facility, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals 
Limited, FEI 3004672766 at Plot No. S-7, Colvale Industrial Estate, 
Colvale, Bardez, Goa from May 12, 2022 to May 20, 
2022. This warning letter summarizes significant violations of Current Good 
Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 21 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 
CFR parts 210 and 211). Because your methods, facilities, or 
controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform 
to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning 
of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). We reviewed your June 
12, 2022, response to our Form FDA 483 in detail 
and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence. During our inspection, 
our investigators observed specific violations including, but not limited to, 
the following. 1. Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate any 
unexplained discrepancy or failure of a batch or any of 
its components to meet any of its specifications, whether or 
not the batch has already been distributed (21 CFR 211.192). 
A. Your investigations into rejected batches failed to extend to 
other batches, dosage strengths, and drug products for tablet compression 
machine settings. From 2018 to 2021, you rejected 14 batches 
of 0.1mg and 0.2mg strength desmopressin acetate tablets for out-of-specification 
(OOS) results for (b)(4) and content uniformity results. You implemented 
additional stratified sampling and conducted engineering batches to simulate the 
root cause for the failures for both dosage strengths. Although 
you attributed the content uniformity failure to the lack of 
defined compression parameters for desmopressin acetate 0.1mg batch 20210776, you 
failed to test other batches or drug products that used 
the same (b)(4) process and compression equipment. In your response, 
you acknowledged batches were rejected for the 0.1mg and 0.2mg 
desmopressin acetate tablets and that you did not apply the 
corrective actions for the compression parameters for your 0.2mg strength 
tablets. As a result of this inspection, you conducted a 
retrospective review and discovered a failing stratified sample assay result 
for desmopressin acetate 0.2mg tablets batch 20220121 and initiated a 
voluntary recall of this batch on June 10, 2022. However, 
your response did not adequately address your firm’s failure to 
investigate the assay failure and market impact at the time 
of its occurrence and it did not include an overall 
management strategy for improving all phases of your investigations. In 
response to this letter, provide the following: 2. Your firm 
failed to establish adequate written procedures for production and process 
control designed to assure that the drug products you manufacture 
have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they purport or 
are represented to possess (21 CFR 211.100(a)). Your firm failed 
to adequately validate the manufacturing process for (b)(4) gel (b)(4)%. 
Specifically, your process validation lacks an evaluation of inter-batch and 
intra-batch variability for (b)(4) gel (b)(4)%. Your initial process performance 
qualification for this drug product only tested (b)(4) random tube 
for viscosity taken from tubes collected at the (b)(4) of 
filling for each of the three validation batches. This study 
did not evaluate variability within the batch, and it is 
not described in the validation report where the (b)(4) tube 
was collected. This sampling plan for viscosity does not result 
in statistical confidence in your process performance. A second process 
performance qualification study was conducted to qualify a critical excipient 
used to control the viscosity of the drug product. The 
study included one batch and therefore inter-batch variability could not 
be assessed to ensure the process consistently produces quality drug 
products. You rejected five batches between 2020 and 2021 for 
failure to meet viscosity specifications of (b)(4) gel (b)(4)%. In 
response to this letter, provide the following: 3. Your firm 
failed to establish and follow required laboratory control mechanisms (21 
CFR 211.160(a)). Your firm failed to have appropriate procedures for 
the integration of chromatographic peaks and for the review of 
chromatographic data processing. A. Our investigators identified an example of 
your firm manually entering timed integration events into the processing 
methods and reporting passing results without adequate procedural controls or 
justification. Your analyst manually modified the processing of chromatographic data 
of (b)(4) impurity peak for (b)(4) tablets batch (b)(4). The 
impurity results would not have met release specification if the 
automatic integration processing had been applied in the same manner 
as they were to the standard and other peaks. In 
addition, your chromatographic data integration procedure is inadequate because it 
does not indicate when the analyst can manually input timed 
integration events, how these events should be used, or how 
they should be reviewed. The procedure does not require supervisory 
approval for manually entering timed integration events, a review of 
the original system integrated chromatogram and justification for manually entering 
the timed events. In your response, you reviewed the accuracy 
of integrations performed using the existing chromatographic data processing procedures 
through a retrospective review conducted for a subset of U.S. 
finished drug product batches within shelf life. You identified an 
additional out of specification value of an unspecified impurity for 
(b)(4) and (b)(4) tablets batch (b)(4). The reported result was 
(b)(4)%, while the reprocessed result after removing timed integration events 
identified as “Set Liftoff%” and “Set touchdown%”, was (b)(4)%, which 
is out of specification for unknown impurity (Release Specification of 
No More Than (b)(4)%). You attributed the reprocessed OOS result 
to a noisy baseline in your investigation. However, your investigation 
lacked data to support the conclusion. The investigation report did 
not include the full-scale chromatographic run, information of the integration 
parameters or the chromatograms for the sample standard and blanks. 
These chromatograms were not provided or discussed in your investigation 
report. It is also not discussed in the investigation report 
if system suitability was met to ensure instrumentation readiness in 
the initial processing. Additionally, the minimum area used to disregard 
peaks during initial processing was calculated incorrectly. The minimum area 
response of (b)(4) was applied instead of the correct (b)(4) 
as per your procedure. No additional peaks were found after 
the reprocessing. In addition, your conclusion fails to explain the 
presence of the same peak in your repeat testing and 
did not provide your forced degradation studies. Your response is 
inadequate because you did not commit to performing a retrospective 
review of all chromatographic data associated with the raw materials, 
active pharmaceutical ingredients, and drug product subject to chromatographic testing. 
B. Your calculations for setting the minimum area for peak 
integration of related substances are not recorded or reviewed by 
quality. During the inspection, an analyst was asked to calculate 
the minimum area for (b)(4) tablets batch (b)(4). The minimum 
area which was used during analysis was calculated incorrectly. The 
change in the minimum area did not change the reportable 
result. However, since the calculation is not recorded, the reviewers 
could not detect if the wrong minimum area is calculated 
and used in the analysis. There is a lack of 
assurance the required peaks of interest have been integrated in 
the chromatographic analysis. In your response, you performed a retrospective 
review of a subset of U.S. finished drug product to 
verify the minimum area used in the processing method against 
the actual calculated minimum area. Numerous finished drug product samples 
were identified in which the minimum area used was greater 
than the calculated minimum area. However, no results were observed 
to be out of specification. Your response is inadequate because 
you did not commit to performing a retrospective review of 
all chromatographic data associated with setting the minimum area for 
related substances to include materials such as active pharmaceutical ingredients. 
In response to this letter, provide the following: 4. Your 
firm failed to prepare batch production and control records with 
complete information relating to the production and control of each 
batch of drug product produced (21 CFR 211.188). Your batch 
records were incomplete and did not contain batch specific data 
for compression machine reject limits. Production operators acknowledged using default 
pre-set tablet rejection values in the recipes for tablet compression 
instead of calculating the batch specific rejection limits as required 
by your procedure. There were two investigations where non-conforming tablets 
were found and did not meet the hardness specifications. In 
each of the investigations the impact assessment concluded that since 
the automatic weight control or compaction force control was turned 
on, the risk of finding tablets that did not meet 
specification was low. However, the investigations did not determine if 
the rejection limits were set appropriately. There was a lack 
of assurance to ensure the compression machine was correctly rejecting 
tablets that did not meet specifications. In your response, you 
initiated a study protocol for established compression machine parameters for 
all tablets manufactured at Glenmark. However, your response is inadequate. 
You did not review the programmable logic control (PLC) recipe 
data to ensure the reject limits were properly calculated and 
entered for all U.S. distributed batches within expiration. In response 
to this letter, please provide the following: (b)(4) Conclusion The 
violations cited in this letter are not intended to be 
an all-inclusive list of violations that exist at your facility. 
You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of 
any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence 
of other violations. If you are considering an action that 
is likely to lead to a disruption in the supply 
of drugs produced at your facility, FDA requests that you 
contact CDER’s Drug Shortages Staff immediately, at drugshortages@fda.hhs.gov, so that 
FDA can work with you on the most effective way 
to bring your operations into compliance with the law. Contacting 
the Drug Shortages Staff also allows you to meet any 
obligations you may have to report discontinuances or interruptions in 
your drug manufacture under 21 U.S.C. 356C(b). This also allows 
FDA to consider, as soon as possible, what actions, if 
any, may be needed to avoid shortages and protect the 
health of patients who depend on your products. This letter 
notifies you of our findings and provides you an opportunity 
to address the above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, 
respond to this office in writing within 15 working days. 
Specify what you have done to address any violations and 
to prevent their recurrence. In response to this letter, you 
may provide additional information for our consideration as we continue 
to assess your activities and practices. If you cannot complete 
corrective actions within 15 working days, state your reasons for 
delay and your schedule for completion. Send your electronic reply 
to CDER-OC-OMQ-Communications@fda.hhs.gov. Identify your response with FEI 3004672766 and ATTN:

FL 32826 United States United States WARNING LETTER October 24, 
2022 


Dear Mr. Burke: The United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your firm, Cryos International 
USA, LLC, located at 2200 N. Alafaya Trail, Suite 550, 
Orlando, Florida between February 9, 2022, and March 8, 2022. 
During the inspection, an FDA investigator documented significant deviations from 
the regulations for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based 
products (HCT/Ps) set forth in Title 21, Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Part 1271 (21 CFR Part 1271) and issued 
under the authority of Section 361 of the Public Health 
Service Act (42 U.S.C. § 264). The deviations documented on 
the Form FDA 483, List of Inspectional Observations (FDA 483), 
were presented to and discussed with you at the conclusion 
of the inspection. The items of concern include, but are 
not limited to, the following: 1) Failure to test a 
specimen from an anonymous semen donor for evidence of infection 
due to relevant communicable disease agents [21 CFR 1271.80(a)]; and/or 
failure to retest anonymous semen donors at least six months 
after the date of donation of semen [21 CFR 1271.85(d)]; 
and/or failure to quarantine semen from anonymous donors until the 
retesting required under 21 CFR 1271.85(d) is complete [21 CFR 
1271.60(a)]. For example: a. The following repeat anonymous semen donors 
were not tested for West Nile Virus (WNV) using an 
FDA-licensed NAT donor screening test at the time of the 
first donation that is recovered within the June 1 through 
October 31 testing period and/or were not retested for WNV 
at least six months after the date of donation of 
semen. In addition, semen was not quarantined as required until 
retesting was complete. i. Semen was collected from donor (b)(6) 
between (b)(6) and (b)(6). Testing for WNV was performed on 
6/3/2021; however, semen vials from these donations were not kept 
in quarantine for at least six months after donation until 
retesting for WNV was complete. Even though retesting was not 
complete, semen vials from these donations were released from quarantine 
on 1/20/2022 for distribution within the U.S., and two semen 
vials (collection date (b)(6)) were distributed to (b)(4) on 2/10/2022. 
ii. Semen was collected from donor (b)(6) on (b)(6), (b)(6), 
and (b)(6). Testing for WNV was performed on 6/28/2021 and 
8/13/2021; however, WNV testing was not performed at the first 
donation or within seven days before or after that donation. 
Additionally, semen vials from these donations were not kept in 
quarantine for at least six months after donation until retesting 
for WNV was complete. Even though retesting was not complete, 
semen vials from three donations were released from quarantine on 
2/15/2022 for distribution within the U.S., and four semen vials 
(collection date (b)(6)) were distributed to (b)(4) on 2/28/2022. iii. 
Semen was collected from donor (b)(6) on (b)(6) and (b)(6). 
Testing for WNV was performed on 8/13/2021; however, WNV testing 
was not performed at the first donation or within seven 
days before or after that donation. Additionally, semen vials from 
these donations were not kept in quarantine for at least 
six months after donation until retesting for WNV was complete. 
Even though retesting was not complete, semen vials from both 
donations were released from quarantine on 12/17/2021 for distribution within 
the U.S., and one semen vial (collection date (b)(6)) was 
distributed to (b)(4) on 2/14/2022. iv. Semen was collected from 
donor (b)(6) between (b)(6) and (b)(6). Testing for WNV was 
performed on 6/29/2021; however, WNV testing was not performed at 
the first donation or within seven days before or after 
that donation. Additionally, semen vials from these donations were not 
kept in quarantine for at least six months after donation 
until retesting for WNV was complete. Even though retesting was 
not complete, semen vials from these donations were released from 
quarantine on 1/5/2022 and 1/14/2022 for distribution within the U.S., 
and one semen vial (collection date (b)(6)) was distributed to 
(b)(4) on 1/27/2022. v. Semen was collected from anonymous donor 
(b)(6) between (b)(6) and (b)(6). Testing for WNV was performed 
on 6/12/2020; however, semen vials from these donations were not 
kept in quarantine for at least six months after donation 
until retesting for WNV was complete. Even though retesting was 
not complete, semen vials from these donations were released from 
quarantine on 4/13/2021 and 6/8/2021 for distribution within the U.S., 
and five semen vials (collection dates (b)(6) and (b)(6)) were 
distributed to (b)(4) on 5/20/2021 and 7/21/2021. vi. Semen was 
collected from anonymous donor (b)(6) between (b)(6) and (b)(6). Testing 
for WNV was performed on 6/15/2020; however, semen vials from 
these donations were not kept in quarantine for at least 
six months after donation until retesting for WNV was complete. 
Even though retesting was not complete, semen vials from these 
donations were released from quarantine on 6/8/2021 for distribution within 
the U.S., and one semen vial (collection date (b)(6)) was 
distributed to (b)(4) on 7/1/2021. b. The following repeat anonymous 
semen donors were not retested for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea, 
Treponema pallidum, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) at least six months after 
the date of donation of semen. In addition, semen was 
not quarantined as required until retesting was complete. i. Semen 
was collected from anonymous donor (b)(6) on (b)(6) and (b)(6); 
however, semen vials from these donations were not kept in 
quarantine for at least six months after donation until retesting 
for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Treponema pallidum, and CMV was 
complete. Semen vials from these donations were released from quarantine 
on 1/14/2022 for distribution within the U.S., and one semen 
vial (collection date (b)(6)) was distributed to (b)(4) on 1/27/2022. 
ii. Semen was collected from anonymous donor (b)(6) between (b)(6) 
and (b)(6); however, semen vials from these donations were not 
kept in quarantine for at least six months after donation 
until retesting for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Treponema pallidum, and 
CMV was complete. Semen vials from these donations were released 
from quarantine on 4/13/2021 for distribution within the U.S., and 
two semen vials (collection date (b)(6)) were distributed to (b)(4) 
on 5/13/2021. 2) Failure to screen a donor of reproductive 
cells or tissue by reviewing the donor’s relevant medical records 
for risk factors for, and clinical evidence of, relevant communicable 
disease agents and diseases [21 CFR 1271.75(a)(1)]. Your firm’s donor 
history questionnaires are used as relevant medical records to determine 
donor eligibility. However, the multiple versions of the form do 
not include screening for all conditions and/or behaviors that increase 
a donor’s relevant communicable disease risk. For example: a. Your 
donor history questionnaire FORM 08.05.01.01.21 Questionnaire Sperm Donor (b)(6), (ver 
1, 01.10.2021) is missing questions to assess a donor’s relevant 
communicable disease risk for the following: i. Men who have 
had sex with another man in the preceding 12 months. 
ii. Persons who have engaged in sex in exchange for 
money or drugs in the preceding 12 months; iii. Persons 
who have injected drugs for non-medical reason in the preceding 
12 months, including intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injections; iv. Persons 
who have been exposed in the preceding 12 months to 
known or suspected HIV, HBV, and/or HCV-infected blood through percutaneous 
inoculation (e.g., needle stick) or through contact with an open 
wound, non-intact skin, or mucous membrane; v. Persons who have 
lived with (resided in the same dwelling) another person who 
has hepatitis B or clinically active (symptomatic) hepatitis C infection 
in the preceding 12 months; vi. Persons who acquired a 
clinically recognizable vaccinia virus infection by contact with someone who 
received the smallpox vaccine; vii. The question that asks about 
spending 6 months or more at U.S. military bases in 
Northern Europe from 1980 through 1990, or elsewhere in Europe 
from 1980 through 1996 does not ask if the time 
was cumulative. viii. Persons who have had a medical diagnosis 
of ZIKV in the past 6 months. ix. Persons who 
have resided in, or traveled to, an area with an 
increased risk for ZIKV transmission within the past 6 months. 
b. Your firm’s FORM 08.01.02.01.05 Change in Risk Behaviours (Ver 
2.2, 15.10.2021) is missing questions to assess a donor’s risk 
for Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, as follows: i. Persons who 
have had sexual contact with a person within the past 
6 months that has traveled to or resided in another 
country with an increased risk for ZIKV transmission within the 
past 6 months; and ii. Persons who have had sexual 
contact with a person within the past 6 months that 
has had a medical diagnosis of ZIKV within the past 
6 months. 3) Failure to perform a complete donor screening 
procedure on a donor by reviewing the donor’s relevant medical 
records as set forth in 21 CFR 1271.75(a). Relevant medical 
records (21 CFR 1271.3(t)) include the donor medical history interview 
and a physical assessment of the donor. An abbreviated donor 
screening procedure may be used for repeat donors if you 
have performed a complete donor screening procedure on a living 
donor within the previous six months. An abbreviated donor screening 
procedure must determine and document any changes in the donor’s 
medical history since the previous donation that would make the 
donor ineligible. For example: a. Semen was collected from repeat 
anonymous donor (b)(6) on (b)(6) and (b)(6). Complete donor screening 
procedures were performed on 6/5/2020 and 1/28/2021. However, semen vials 
from these donations were released from quarantine on 7/26/2021 for 
distribution within the U.S. without a complete donor screening procedure 
within the previous six months. Two semen vials (collection date 
(b)(6)) were distributed to (b)(4) on 9/3/2021. b. Semen was 
collected from repeat anonymous donor (b)(6) on (b)(6) and (b)(6). 
Complete donor screening procedures were performed on 11/19/2020 and 6/15/2021. 
However, semen vials from these donations were released from quarantine 
on 1/20/2022 for distribution within the U.S. without a complete 
donor screening procedure within the previous six months. One semen 
vial (collection date (b)(6)) was distributed to (b)(4) on 1/24/2022. 
c. Semen was collected from repeat anonymous donor (b)(6) on 
(b)(6). Complete donor screening procedures were performed on 3/10/2020 and 
9/22/2020. However, semen vials from this donation were released from 
quarantine on 4/28/2021 for distribution within the U.S. without a 
complete donor screening procedure within the previous six months. One 
semen vial (collection date (b)(6)) was distributed to (b)(4) on 
8/31/2021. 4) Failure to establish and maintain procedures for all 
steps performed in testing, screening, determining donor eligibility, and complying 
with all other requirements of Subpart C “Donor Eligibility” in 
21 CFR Part 1271.45-1271.90 [21 CFR 1271.47(a)]. For example, your 
firm’s procedure Human Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps) Reproductive Tissue 
Bank Manual, updated 6/6/2019, is deficient in that: a. The 
Syphilis infection section states that “persons who have had or 
have been treated for syphilis or gonorrhea during the preceding 
12 months” would be ineligible. However, the procedure does not 
include Chlamydia trachomatis. b. The CJD or vCJD infection section 
states that persons who “received any transfusion of blood or 
blood components in the U.K. between 1980 and the present” 
would be ineligible, but this section does not include France. 
c. The CJD or vCJD infection section does not ask 
about a cumulative timeframe for the question related to current 
or former U.S. military members, civilian military employees, or dependents 
of a military member or civilian employee. d. The West 
Nile Virus section states, “effective October 1st, 2016 all donors 
will be screened for West Nile Virus seasonally. All donors 
will be tested for West Nile Virus at their first 
donation between the months of June through October each year. 
Egg donors will be screened within 30 days of their 
scheduled donation procedure. Sperm donors will be screened when they 
provide their first donation during the included months and at 
each batch close during those months.” However, the procedure does 
not require West Nile Virus testing at least six months 
after the date of donation for the retesting of anonymous 
semen donors. e. The Zika Virus section states, “All donors 
are screened for travel to affected areas within the previous 
six months, have had a diagnosis of Zika in the 
previous six months, or in the case of oocyte donors, 
had sex with a and who has traveled to an 
affected area or been diagnosed with Zika in the previous 
six months.” The question does not screen for donors, to 
include semen donors, who have had sex with a person 
who has traveled to an affected area or been diagnosed 
with Zika in the previous six months. The deviations identified 
above are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of 
deficiencies at your facility. It is your responsibility to ensure 
that your establishment is in compliance with all applicable requirements 
of the federal regulations. You are responsible for reviewing your 
firm’s operations as a whole to ensure that you are 
in compliance with all applicable FDA regulatory requirements. We acknowledge 
receipt of your letter dated March 22, 2022, in response 
to the FDA 483. We have reviewed the corrective actions 
outlined in the response, and we have determined that they 
are inadequate to address our concerns. In response to observation 
1, you object on the basis that FDA’s guidance documents 
contain “non-binding” recommendations. Indeed, it is FDA’s regulation at 21 
CFR 1271.3(r) that provides a definition of “relevant communicable disease 
agent or disease” (RCDAD) and lists specific disease agents identified 
as RCDADs. FDA regulations also provide a mechanism for designating 
additional RCDADs in the future, based on the risk of 
transmission, severity of effects, and development of appropriate screening measures 
and/or the availability of an appropriate FDA-licensed, approved or cleared 
screening test for donor specimens. At the time these regulations 
were promulgated, the agency stated that it would issue guidance 
that notifies HCT/P establishments when the agency believes additional relevant 
communicable disease agents or diseases meet the definition in 21 
CFR 1271.3(r)(2). In September 2016, FDA identified WNV as a 
RCDAD, based on the risk of transmission, severity of effects, 
and availability of appropriate screening measures. In accordance with 21 
CFR 1271.75, you must screen HCT/P donors for risk factors 
for, and clinical evidence of, RCDADs. In accordance with 21 
CFR 1271.80 and 1271.85, you must test HCT/P donors for 
evidence of infection due to relevant communicable disease agents to 
adequately and appropriately reduce the risk of transmission of relevant 
communicable diseases. An FDA-licensed donor screening NAT assay for WNV 
is available and testing is required in accordance with 21 
CFR 1271.85(a). Additionally, in the case of a repeat anonymous 
semen donor from whom a specimen has already been collected 
and tested, and for whom retesting is required under 21 
CFR 1271.85(d), you are not required to collect a donor 
specimen at the time of each donation (21 CFR 1271.80(b)(2)). 
However, you should collect a specimen for WNV NAT at 
the time of (or within 7 days before or after) 
the first donation that is recovered within the June 1st 
through October 31st testing period, even if an earlier specimen 
was already collected and tested. You must also quarantine semen 
from anonymous donors until the retesting required under 21 CFR 
1271.85(d) is compete, as required under 21 CFR 1271.60(a). We 
have the following additional comments regarding your response to the 
FDA 483: For example, you stated, “(b)(6) testing for these 
communicable diseases listed above was performed on 6/29/21, 9/14/21, 10/19/21, 
11/23/21, 12/13/21, and 1/27/22 before the release of the samples 
and all results were negative or non-reactive.” The donations in 
question were collected on (b)(6) and (b)(6). The six-month quarantine 
period for these donations would end no later than 12/17/2021, 
12/22/2021, and 12/29/2021, respectively. These donations were released from quarantine 
on 1/14/2022 for distribution within the U.S. Testing of the 
donor for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Treponema pallidum, and CMV 
was performed on the dates noted above, which were either 
before the end of the six-month quarantine or after the 
release of the units from quarantine. We acknowledge your intent 
to implement retesting for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Treponema pallidum, 
and CMV at least 6 months after donation, along with 
retraining. Please note that if you still have oocytes or 
semen in storage from donors whose screening and/or testing was 
not completed in accordance with 21 CFR 1271, FDA considers 
the donor eligibility determinations to be incomplete for these donors. 
For example, donors who were not tested for WNV, donors 
who were screened using a donor history questionnaire that was 
missing required screening questions, and donors who were not appropriately 
screened for ZIKV risk factors. Therefore, as required by 21 
CFR 1271.60(a), you must keep these HCT/Ps in quarantine. Should 
the need arise in the future to remove any of 
these HCT/Ps from quarantine, either for use in your own 
establishment or for transport to another establishment, you may request 
an exemption or alternative from a requirement in subpart C, 
21 CFR Part 1271, as specified in 21 CFR 1271.155. 
Additional information can be found at: Exemptions and Alternatives | 
FDA. The email address for submissions is HCTPExemptions@fda.hhs.gov. Please note 
that 21 CFR 1271.155 requires that you provide justification for 
use of HCT/Ps from these donors, as well as information 
on how you have mitigated the risk consistent with the 
goals of protecting the public health and/or preventing the introduction, 
transmission, or spread of communicable diseases. Before any of these 
HCT/Ps can be removed from quarantine, the request must be 
granted by FDA. If you still have embryos in storage 
for which the donor eligibility requirements under 21 CFR Part 
1271, Subpart C are not met, please note that FDA 
considers the donor eligibility determinations to be incomplete for these 
donors. Therefore, as required by 21 CFR 1271.60(a), you must 
keep these HCT/Ps in quarantine. Should the need arise in 
the future to remove any of these HCT/Ps from quarantine, 
either for use in your own establishment or for transport 
to another establishment, you may release these HCT/Ps from quarantine 
(21 CFR 1271.90(b)) provided they are labeled in accordance with 
the applicable regulations at 21 CFR 1271.90(c). We request that 
you respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from 
your receipt of this letter, outlining the specific steps you 
have taken or plan to take to correct the noted 
violations, including an explanation of how you plan to prevent 
these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include any 
documentation necessary to show that correction has been achieved. If 
you cannot complete all corrective actions within fifteen (15) working 
days, please explain the reason for your delay and the 
timeframe within which the remaining corrections will be completed. Given 
the seriousness of these violations, we also request your attendance 
at a Regulatory Meeting, within 30 calendar days of receipt 
of this letter, to discuss the status of the specific 
steps you have taken since the inspection to correct the 
noted violations. We will host the meeting virtually on Zoom. 
This meeting will also allow you to ask any questions 
you may have and to provide FDA additional information regarding 
implementation of corrective actions. Please contact Colleen Aspinwall, Compliance Officer, 
at (561) 416-1065, ext. 1105 or by email at Colleen.Aspinwall@fda.hhs.gov 
for confirmation of the meeting date and time. A call-in 
phone number for the Zoom meeting will be provided at 
that time. Your response should be sent to Colleen Aspinwall, 
Compliance Officer at the following email address: Colleen.Aspinwall@fda.hhs.gov. If you 
should have any questions, please contact Ms. Aspinwall at (561) 
416-1065 ext. 1105 or via e-mail.

United States United States December 8, 2022 WARNING LETTER 


Dear 
Mr. McCoy: The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions to 
the FDA and our inspection records, and determined that Vapors 
of Ohio Inc d/b/a Nostalgic Vapes manufactures and distributes e-liquid 
products for commercial distribution in the United States, and that 
the e-liquid products are manufactured and offered for sale or 
distribution to customers in the United States. Under section 201(rr) 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) 
(21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because 
they are made or derived from tobacco or contain nicotine 
from any source, and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco 
products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under 
section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) 
and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1, and are required to be 
in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act. Please 
be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed 
legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA’s jurisdiction 
to products “containing nicotine from any source,” not just nicotine 
derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 
117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation 
expanded the definition of “tobacco product” under section 201(rr) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include products 
containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including e-liquid products, 
containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with 
the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, 
please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14. Generally, to be legally marketed in the 
United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to 
have a premarket authorization in effect. A “new tobacco product” 
is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in 
the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any 
modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 
2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 
387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for 
a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the 
product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order 
finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product 
(section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer 
submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by 
exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA 
under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387e(j)(3)). A New Tobacco Product Without Required Marketing Authorization Is 
Adulterated and Misbranded FDA has determined that you manufacture, sell, 
and/or distribute to customers in the United States FLVR SHOP 
E-LIQUID GLZD-DNT 6mg 120ml e-liquid product without a marketing authorization 
order. The e-liquid product listed above is a new tobacco 
product because it was not commercially marketed in the United 
States as of February 15, 2007. This product does not 
have FDA marketing authorization order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) 
of the FD&C Act and is not otherwise exempt from 
the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, this product is adulterated under 
section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). 
In addition, it is misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or 
other information respecting this product was not provided as required 
by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. The doing of 
any act with respect to a tobacco product while such 
article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce 
which results in such product being adulterated or misbranded is 
a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, to the extent that a 
report was required under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, 
the failure to provide such report is a prohibited act 
under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
331(p)). Conclusion and Requested Actions FDA has not received an 
application from your firm requesting marketing authorization for the product 
listed in this Warning Letter. This product and any other 
new tobacco product on the market without the statutorily required 
premarket authorization are adulterated and misbranded and are subject to 
enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. It is your responsibility to 
ensure that all of your tobacco products comply with each 
applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. 
Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 
U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco 
products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 
1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but 
not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, 
this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes 
of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that 
tobacco products offered for import into the United States that 
appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or 
refused admission. The violations discussed in this letter do not 
necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action 
to address any violations that are referenced above, as well 
as violations that are the same as or similar to 
the ones stated above, and take any necessary actions to 
bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act. 
Please submit a written response to this letter within 15 
working days from the date of receipt describing your actions 
to address any violations and bring your products into compliance, 
including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, 
and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for 
maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that 
your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, 
include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. 
This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you 
with an opportunity to address them. You can find the 
FD&C Act through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov. Please 
note your reference number, ER2200731, in your response and direct

79936 United States United States December 8, 2022 WARNING LETTER 



Dear Mr. Mendoza: The Center for Tobacco Products of the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions 
to the FDA and our inspection records, and determined that 
Cloud House Vape manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for commercial 
distribution in the United States, and that the e-liquid products 
are manufactured and offered for sale or distribution to customers 
in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 
321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made 
or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain 
tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction 
under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387a(b)). Therefore, these products are required to be in compliance 
with the requirements in the FD&C Act. Please be aware 
that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting 
the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories to these 
newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation under the 
FD&C Act. These products include, but are not limited to, 
electronic nicotine delivery systems (including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and 
pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be 
Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as 
Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; 
Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and 
Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 
(May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. The FD&C Act requires 
“new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization in effect. 
A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was 
not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 
15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially 
marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C 
Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order 
under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) 
the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 
905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and 
FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to 
a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) 
or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all 
modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial 
equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)). New Tobacco Products Without Required 
Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded FDA has determined that 
you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to customers in the United 
States Blue Monster e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order. 
The tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because 
they were not commercially marketed in the United States as 
of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA 
marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the 
FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing 
authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, 
they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information 
respecting these products was not provided as required by section 
905(j) of the FD&C Act. The doing of any act 
with respect to a tobacco product while such article is 
held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results 
in such product being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited 
act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 331(k)).” Additionally, to the extent that a report was 
required under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure 
to provide such report is a prohibited act under section 
301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)). Conclusion 
and Requested Actions FDA received your Premarket Tobacco Product Application 
(PMTA), assigned STN PM0003153, on September 10, 2020. However, FDA 
issued a negative action for STN PM0003153 in the form 
of a Refuse To Accept determination on October 19, 2021, 
which covers 812 products. As discussed above, new tobacco products 
that do not have the required FDA marketing authorization order 
in effect, including your ENDS products covered by STN PM0003153 
that resulted in a Refuse To Accept determination, are adulterated 
and misbranded. All new tobacco products on the market without 
the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are 
subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. Products for which 
no application is pending, including, for example, those with a 
Marketing Denial Order and those for which no application was 
submitted, are among our highest enforcement priorities. For more information 
on how FDA intends to prioritize enforcement resources with regard 
to the marketing of certain adulterated and misbranded ENDS and 
other deemed new tobacco products, please refer to the FDA’s 
guidance titled Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) 
and Other Deemed Products on the Market Without Premarket Authorization, 
available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market. It is your responsibility to ensure that 
all of your tobacco products comply with each applicable provision 
of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to 
address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 
301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products including 
the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 
1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited 
to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning 
Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 
303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products 
offered for import into the United States that appear to 
be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission. 
The violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute 
an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address 
any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations 
that are the same as or similar to the ones 
stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your 
tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act. Please submit 
a written response to this letter within 15 working days 
from the date of receipt describing your actions to address 
any violations and bring your products into compliance, including the 
dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution 
of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance 
with the FD&C Act. If you believe that your products 
are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your 
reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This letter 
notifies you of our findings and provides you with an 
opportunity to address them. You can find the FD&C Act 
through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov. Please note your

# 641801 


Dear Ms. Vera K. Itzhakov: On July 19 
through August 4, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
conducted a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of Euphoria 
Fancy Food Inc. located at 149 2nd Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 
11215. We also conducted an inspection on August 13, 2019. 
These inspections were conducted to determine compliance with the requirements 
of section 805 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP 
regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L. The FSVP 
regulation requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify 
that human and/or animal food they import into the United 
States has been produced in a manner that meets applicable 
U.S. food safety standards. You may find information relating to 
the FSVP regulation and your responsibilities to comply with the 
regulation through links in FDA's FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals 
During the most recent inspection, we found that you are 
not in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 
1, subpart L for the foods you import. During our 
inspection, you stated you did not have FSVP records for 
any foods you import. Because of these significant violations, you 
are not in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C 
Act. At the conclusion of the inspection, our investigator provided 
you with a Form FDA 483a FSVP Observations. We acknowledge 
receipt of your emailed response dated August 5, 2022. In 
your email, you stated that you hired a consultant to 
come to your company on (b)(4) and help with your 
FSVP. You further stated that the factories you work with 
provided paperwork (b)(4) and you needed additional time to translate 
the documents. Your response did not include any documents or 
additional details regarding the information you said you obtained from 
your suppliers, as related to the FSVP requirements. Further, aside 
from stating the need to translate documents from your suppliers 
and meet with a consultant, you have not provided specific 
steps or actions you have taken or plan to take 
to come into compliance with the FSVP regulation. Our review 
of your response finds that you have not addressed the 
violations related to the food products you import. Specifically, you 
have not made any corrections or developed FSVPs for the 
foods you import in response to the Form FDA 483a 
issued on August 4, 2022. We acknowledged your response initially 
on August 17, 2022 and requested contact information for your 
consulting company and your timeline for compliance. We sent a 
follow-up email on August 24, 2022 and have not received 
a response from your firm to date. Your significant violations 
of the FSVP regulation are as follows: You did not 
develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by Section 
805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 1.502(a). Specifically, 
you did not develop an FSVP for any foods that 
you import, including the following foods: The above violations are 
not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations of 
the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that 
you are in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C 
Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 1, 
subpart L. This letter notifies you of our concerns and 
provides you an opportunity to address them. If you do 
not adequately address this matter, we may take further action. 
For instance, we may take action under section 801(a)(3) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of 
the food you import for which you appear to be 
in violation of section 805. We may place the foods 
you import into the United States on detention without physical 
examination (DWPE) when you import the foods. You can find 
DWPE information relating to FSVP in Import Alert # 99 
41 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or offering for 
importation into the United States of an article of food 
without the importer having an FSVP that meets the requirements 
of section 805 of the FD&C Act or the FSVP 
regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. 331(zz)). You should respond in writing within fifteen 
(15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your 
response should address the specific things you are doing to 
correct any violations. You should include in your response documentation 
and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections 
(e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as a copy 
of your FSVP, records to demonstrate implementation of your FSVP), 
and any additional information that you wish to supply relevant 
to your compliance with the FSVP regulation. If you believe 
that you are not in violation of the FD&C Act, 
include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. 
If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 working days, 
you should explain the reason for your delay and state 
when you will correct any remaining violations. Please send your 
reply to Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Linda Ross, Compliance 
Officer, Division of Northeast Imports, ORAOEIONEIMPORTSWLResponses@fda.hhs.gov. Please also cc (carbon

Dear Ms. Cecilia (NMI) Alvarez: From July 26, 
2022 to July 28, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) conducted a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of 
Cecilia Alvarez located at 409 E. Geranium Ave., McAllen, TX 
78501-1518. We also conducted an FSVP inspection from April 21, 
2020 to April 23, 2020. These inspections were conducted to 
determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 
384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 CFR part 
1, subpart L. The FSVP regulation requires that importers perform 
certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or animal food

we found that you are not in compliance with the 
requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart L for the 
foods you import. Because of these significant violations, you are 
not in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act. 
At the conclusion of the inspection, our investigator provided you 
with a Form FDA 483a, FSVP Observations. We have not 
received your response to the Form FDA 483a issued on 
July 28, 2022. Your significant violations of the FSVP regulation 
are as follows: You did not develop, maintain, and follow 
an FSVP, as required by section 805 of the FD&C 
Act and 21 CFR 1.502(a). Specifically, you did not develop 
an FSVP for any foods that you import, including the 
following foods: The above violations are not intended to be 
an all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. It 
is your responsibility to ensure that you are in compliance 
with section 805 of the FD&C Act and the implementing 
regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L. Additionally, we 
offer the following comments: During our most recent inspection, our 
investigator noted your firm may qualify as a “very small 
importer” under 21 CFR 1.500. If you meet the definition, 
you are still required to follow FSVP requirements, but you 
may choose to comply with the modified requirements in 21 
CFR 1.512. If you choose to comply with such modified 
requirements, you must document that you meet the definition of 
“very small importer” on an annual basis as required per 
21 CFR 1.512(b)(1)(i). In addition, we note, as a very 
small importer, for each food you import, you must obtain 
written assurance, in accordance with 21 CFR 1.512(b)(3), before importing 
the food and at least every two years thereafter, that 
your foreign supplier is producing the food in compliance with 
processes and procedures that provide at least the same level 
of public health protection as those required under section 418 
or 419 of the FD&C Act, if either is applicable, 
and the implementing regulations, and is producing the food in 
compliance with sections 402 and 403(w) (if applicable) of the 
FD&C Act. You may find information on documenting your eligibility 
as a very small importer and the other requirements under 
21 CFR 1.512 in the “Draft Guidance for Industry Foreign 
Supplier Verification Programs for Imports of Food for Human and

85008 United States United States December 2, 2022 WARNING LETTER 



Dear Geoff Habicht and Amir Hakak: The Center for Tobacco 
Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently 
reviewed the website https://www.mipod.com and determined that the electronic nicotine 
delivery system (ENDS) products listed there are manufactured and offered 
for sale or distribution to customers in the United States. 
Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are 
tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco 
and are intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including 
ENDS, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. 
§ 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with 
the requirements in the FD&C Act. Please be aware that, 
effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the 
definition of a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly 
deemed products, to be subject to regulation under the FD&C 
Act. These products include, but are not limited to, ENDS 
(including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final 
Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family 
Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale 
and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for 
Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available 
at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. Generally, to be legally marketed in the United 
States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have 
a premarket authorization order in effect. A “new tobacco product” 
is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in 
the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any 
modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 
2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 
387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for 
a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the 
product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order 
finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product 
(section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer 
submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by 
exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA 
under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387e(j)(3)). New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated 
and Misbranded Our review of the website https://www.mipod.com revealed that 
you manufacture and offer for sale or distribution to customers 
in the United States ENDS products without a marketing authorization 
order, including Smoking Vapor Blueberry Cartridges 50pk, Smoking Vapor Vanilla 
Cartridges 50pk, and Smoking Vapor Grape Blend E-Cigar. The ENDS 
products listed above are new tobacco products because they were 
not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 
15, 2007. These products do not have an FDA marketing 
authorization order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C 
Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization 
requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of 
the FD&C Act. In addition, these products are misbranded under 
section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act because a notice or 
other information respecting these products were not provided as required 
by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. Conclusion and Requested 
Actions FDA has not received an application from your firm 
requesting marketing authorization for the products listed in this warning 
letter. FDA received your Premarket Tobacco Product Applications (PMTAs) assigned 
PMTA STN PM0003909, and PM0004492 on September 9, 2020, and 
January 6, 2021, which cover 14 products, but do not 
include the new tobacco products listed in this Warning Letter. 
Your firm continues to manufacture and/or offer for sale or 
distribution to consumers in the United States new tobacco products, 
including those listed in this Warning Letter, that are not 
included in your firm’s PMTAs and lack premarket authorization. All 
new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required 
premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement 
action at FDA’s discretion. The violations discussed in this letter

Nagar Nawanshahr 144533 Punjab India United States Warning Letter 320-23-06 
December 7, 2022 


Dear Mr. Sharma: The U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your drug manufacturing facility, Centrient Pharmaceuticals 
India Private Limited, FEI 3004497364, at Bhai Mohan Singh Nagar, 
Toansa, Dist. SBS Nagar (Nawanshahr), Punjab from June 23 to 
July 1, 2022. This warning letter summarizes significant deviations from 
current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). 
Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, 
or holding do not conform to CGMP, your API are 
adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). 
We reviewed your July 22, 2022, response to our Form 
FDA 483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent 
correspondence. During our inspection, our investigators observed specific deviations including, 
but not limited to, the following. 1. Failure of your 
quality unit to exercise its responsibility to ensure the API 
manufactured at your facility are in compliance with CGMP. Your 
quality unit (QU) failed to ensure adequate document control over 
paper and electronic records. For example, our investigators observed numerous 
logbooks, forms, and partially completed “Sample Request For Analysis (Other 
Than SAP)” in an uncontrolled temporary storage room near your 
microbiology laboratory. Our investigators also observed in your document center, 
a document shredder labeled for “emergency use” containing shredded documents. 
Your document control personnel were unable to identify the documents 
in the shredder that were observed to contain information for 
relative humidity, temperature, and data recorded in writing. You also 
failed to have adequate controls for your computerized systems. For 
example, multiple usernames and passwords for software login of several 
users’ information were handwritten in an uncontrolled notebook of your 
senior executive microbiologist. The login information was for software used 
to control laboratory equipment, such as incubators for the storage 
of product and (b)(4) water samples. To ensure data integrity, 
actions performed need to be attributable to a specific individual. 
Your response indicates you plan to revise multiple standard operating 
procedures and intend to centralize document control by forming a 
new document control center and document control team. Your response 
also indicates your senior executive microbiologist had an administrator role 
in the “ICDAS” software and they were subsequently reassigned to 
an operator role. However, your response does not provide a 
detailed plan to ensure your future paper and electronic record 
and documentation practices comply with CGMP. Your response is also 
inadequate because it does not include a comprehensive retrospective risk 
assessment of the impact and scope for the inadequate document 
control at your facility, and it does not fully address 
tiered user access and controls to ensure access is appropriate 
to each users’ role and administrative roles are adequately controlled. 
Your documentation practices are not indicative of a facility that 
is in compliance with CGMP. Document control is essential to 
maintaining an adequate quality system. In response to this letter, 
provide: • A comprehensive assessment and remediation plan to ensure 
your QU is given the authority and resources to effectively 
function. The assessment should also include, but not be limited 
to: o A determination of whether procedures used by your 
firm are robust and appropriate. o Provisions for QU oversight 
throughout your operations to evaluate adherence to appropriate practices. o 
A complete and final review of each batch and its 
related information before the QU disposition decision. o Oversight and 
approval of investigations and discharging of all other QU duties 
to ensure identity, strength, quality, and purity of all products. 
• A complete assessment of documentation systems used throughout your 
manufacturing and laboratory operations to determine where documentation practices are 
insufficient. Include a detailed corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) 
plan that comprehensively remediates your firm’s documentation practices to ensure 
you retain attributable, legible, complete, original, accurate, contemporaneous records throughout 
your operation. • A comprehensive assessment and CAPA plan for 
computer system security and integrity. Include a report that identifies 
vulnerabilities in design and controls, and appropriate remediations for each 
of your laboratory computer systems. 2. Failure to ensure that 
all test procedures are scientifically sound and appropriate to ensure 
that your API conform to established standards of quality and 
purity. You failed to ensure that your test procedures were 
appropriately validated and established procedures were followed. For example, your 
recovery studies were not adequate to demonstrate that the method 
for beta-lactam environmental monitoring can recover beta-lactam residue by swab 
sampling. Additionally, your established procedure for swab collection was not 
followed. Scientifically sound test procedures are a necessary part of 
an effective beta-lactam containment program to prevent cross-contamination, including ensuring 
that API contaminated with beta-lactams can be adequately detected. Contamination 
of non-beta-lactam drugs with beta-lactam drugs presents great risk to 
patient safety, including potential anaphylaxis and death. No safe level 
of penicillin contamination has been determined to be a tolerable 
risk. Severe allergenic responses can occur in susceptible patients exposed 
to extremely low levels of penicillin and other beta-lactams. Your 
response indicates there is no impact to product quality. However, 
your response is inadequate because your justification is based on 
testing performed by a method used to detect beta-lactams in 
the buildings where non-beta-lactam drugs are manufactured that was not 
appropriately validated and was not followed. Additionally, your method for 
detecting penicillin in environmental monitoring of beta-lactams in the non-beta-lactam 
buildings at your facility is not sufficiently sensitive to detect 
very low levels of contamination. For additional information, see FDA’s 
published analytical method that has a limit of detection (LOD) 
of 0.2 ppb at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29766324/. Because of the extremely low 
threshold dose at which an allergic response could occur, beta-lactam 
facilities need to be complete and comprehensively separated from non-beta-lactam 
facilities. For additional information, see FDA’s guidance document Non-Penicillin Beta-Lactam 
Drugs: A CGMP Framework for Preventing Cross-Contamination at https://www.fda.gov/media/79971/download. In 
response to this letter, provide: • A comprehensive assessment of 
your laboratory practices, procedures, methods, documentation, and analyst competencies. Based 
on this review, provide a detailed plan to remediate and 
evaluate the effectiveness of your laboratory system. • A comprehensive 
assessment of your containment controls to prevent beta-lactam cross-contamination including, 
but not limited to, whether you perform any sampling and 
testing of the air exhaust of the beta-lactam manufacturing buildings 
and common areas (e.g., cafeteria) and associated test results for 
the last 2 years. • A commitment to either validate 
and implement FDA’s analytical method for the analysis of beta-lactam 
contamination in your environment and in non-beta-lactam drug products to 
achieve an LOD of 0.2 ppb or validate and implement 
an analytical method with an LOD that is equivalent or 
better than 0.2 ppb. 3. Failure to establish and follow 
written procedures for investigating critical deviations or the failure of 
API batches to meet specifications. You failed to adequately investigate 
and determine the root cause of black particles in two 
batches of (b)(4) API. For example, your investigation report for 
(b)(4) batch (b)(4) stated the black particles were non-metallic charred 
product residue. Your report further indicated that the sample was 
observed by analysis to “dissolve in solution.” However, during the 
inspection, you were unable to provide our investigator the data 
to support the conclusion. Well documented, thorough, scientifically sound investigations 
are necessary to identify the root cause in order to 
implement appropriate CAPAs. Your response indicates you installed (b)(4) to 
limit the presence of metal particles in the API. However, 
your investigation remains inadequate because you did not provide the 
data to support your proposed root cause or identify an 
adequate CAPA. For example, your CAPA does not address non-metallic 
sources of contamination, such as charred product residue or inadequate 
cleaning or fully address metallic sources of contamination, such as 
reactive, additive, or absorptive product contact surfaces. In response to 
this letter, provide: A comprehensive assessment of your overall system 
for investigating deviations, discrepancies, complaints, out-of-specification (OOS) results, and failures. 
Provide a detailed action plan to remediate this system. Your 
action plan should include, but not be limited to, significant 
improvements in investigation competencies, scope determination, root cause evaluation, CAPA 
effectiveness, quality unit oversight, and written procedures. Address how your 
firm will ensure all phases of investigations are appropriately conducted. 
Data Integrity Remediation Your quality system does not adequately ensure 
the accuracy and integrity of data to support the safety, 
effectiveness, and quality of the drugs you manufacture. See FDA’s 
guidance document Data Integrity and Compliance With Drug CGMP for 
guidance on establishing and following CGMP compliant data integrity practices 
at https://www.fda.gov/media/119267/download. We acknowledge that you are using a consultant 
to audit your operation and assist in meeting FDA requirements. 
In response to this letter, provide: A. A comprehensive investigation 
into the extent of the inaccuracies in data records and 
reporting including results of the data review for drugs distributed 
to the United States. Include a detailed description of the 
scope and root causes of your data integrity lapses. B. 
A current risk assessment of the potential effects of the 
observed failures on the quality of your drugs. Your assessment 
should include analyses of the risks to patients caused by 
the release of drugs affected by a lapse of data 
integrity and analyses of the risks posed by ongoing operations. 
C. A management strategy for your firm that includes the 
details of your global CAPA plan. The detailed corrective action 
plan should describe how you intend to ensure the reliability 
and completeness of all data generated by your firm including 
microbiological and analytical data, manufacturing records, and all data submitted 
to FDA. CGMP Consultant Recommended Based upon the nature of 
the deviations we identified at your firm, you should engage 
a consultant qualified to evaluate your operations and to assist 
your firm in meeting CGMP requirements if your firm intends 
to resume manufacturing drugs for the U.S. market. The qualified 
consultant should also perform a comprehensive audit of your entire 
operation for CGMP compliance and evaluate the completion and efficacy 
of your corrective actions and preventive actions before you pursue 
resolution of your firm’s compliance status with FDA. Your use 
of a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to 
comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for 
resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP 
compliance. Conclusion The deviations cited in this letter are not 
intended to be an all-inclusive list of deviations that exist 
at your facility. You are responsible for investigating and determining 
the causes of any deviations and for preventing their recurrence 
or the occurrence of other deviations. If you are considering 
an action that is likely to lead to a disruption 
in the supply of drugs produced at your facility, FDA 
requests that you contact CDER’s Drug Shortages Staff immediately, at 
drugshortages@fda.hhs.gov, so that FDA can work with you on the 
most effective way to bring your operations into compliance with 
the law. Contacting the Drug Shortages Staff also allows you 
to meet any obligations you may have to report discontinuances 
or interruptions in your drug manufacture under 21 U.S.C. 356C(b). 
This also allows FDA to consider, as soon as possible, 
what actions, if any, may be needed to avoid shortages 
and protect the health of patients who depend on your 
products. FDA placed your firm on Import Alert 66-40 on 
November 21, 2022. Correct any deviations promptly. FDA may withhold 
approval of new applications or supplements listing your firm as 
a drug manufacturer until any deviations are completely addressed and 
we confirm your compliance with CGMP. We may re-inspect to 
verify that you have completed corrective actions to any deviations. 
Failure to address any deviations may also result in the 
FDA continuing to refuse admission of articles manufactured at Centrient 
Pharmaceuticals India Private Limited, at Bhai Mohan Singh Nagar, Toansa, 
Dist. SBS Nagar (Nawanshahr), Punjab into the United States under 
section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3). Articles 
under this authority that appear to be adulterated may be 
detained or refused admission, in that the methods and controls 
used in their manufacture do not appear to conform to 
CGMP within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C 
Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). This letter notifies you of our 
findings and provides you an opportunity to address the above 
deficiencies. After you receive this letter, respond to this office 
in writing within 15 working days.1 Specify what you have 
done to address any deviations and to prevent their recurrence. 
In response to this letter, you may provide additional information 
for our consideration as we continue to assess your activities 
and practices. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 
working days, state your reasons for delay and your schedule 
for completion. Send your electronic reply to CDER-OC-OMQ-Communications@fda.hhs.gov. Identify your 
response with FEI 3004497364 and ATTN: Lynnsey Renn.

States United States WARNING LETTER Re: CMS 641031 


Dear Mr. 
McDonald Romain: On July 5, 2022, through July 21, 2022, 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a Foreign Supplier 
Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of Gobwa Exotic Imports Inc., located 
at 1127 Nostrand Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11225. We also conducted 
an inspection on February 9, 2021, through March 4, 2021. 
These inspections were conducted to determine compliance with the requirements 
of section 805 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP 
regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L. The FSVP 
regulation requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify 
that human and/or animal food they import into the United 
States has been produced in a manner that meets applicable 
U.S. food safety standards. You may find information relating to 
the FSVP regulation and your responsibilities to comply with the 
regulation through links in FDA’s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals. 
During the most recent inspection, we found that you are 
not in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 
1, subpart L for the foods you import. Because of 
these significant violations, you are not in compliance with section 
805 of the FD&C Act. At the conclusion of the 
inspection, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483a 
FSVP Observations. We acknowledge receipt of your response to the 
Form FDA 483a, dated August 8, 2022. In your response, 
you stated that your first step was to contact consultants 
to assist you in furnishing FSVPs within 30 business days. 
However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of this 
portion of the response because you did not provide documentation 
of specific actions you or your consultants have taken to 
develop your FSVPs. Your response also stated that the “(b)(4) 
will provide [you] with an auditor to do in person 
inspection” (b)(4), “to ensure they meet sanitary guidelines.” You further 
stated that you are researching an auditor (b)(4) to conduct 
inspections (b)(4). To the extent that the audits you reference 
in your response will be part of your activities to 
demonstrate compliance with the FSVP regulation, we are unable to 
evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not 
provide relevant details, including the standards against which these audits 
will be performed or how you intend to integrate them 
into your FSVPs. Further, you did not indicate an expected 
completion date for these audits. Your response also included a 
(b)(4) used at (b)(4), dated July 26, 2022, and for 
your FSVP for fresh hot peppers imported from (b)(4), you 
provided a (b)(4), dated “06/05/2022-08/05/2022” and a (b)(4) “15-07-2022”. We 
further address these records and your response below. Your significant 
violations of the FSVP regulation are as follows: 1. You 
did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP as required 
by section 805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 
part 1.502(a). Specifically, you did not develop, maintain, and follow 
an FSVP for the following foods you import: You import 
fresh produce, that is “covered produce” as defined in 21 
CFR 112.3. As an importer of covered produce, you must 
have an FSVP that demonstrates that your supplier is producing 
the food in compliance with processes and procedures that provide 
at least the same level of public health protection as 
those required under section 419 of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 350h) (regarding standards for produce safety) and the 
implementing regulations in the Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, 
and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption (21 CFR part 
112). 2. You must conduct a written hazard analysis for 
each type of food you import to determine whether there 
are any hazards requiring a control, as required by 21 
CFR 1.504(a). Although you may meet this requirement by reviewing 
and assessing the hazard analysis conducted by another entity using 
a qualified individual, you must document your review and assessment 
of that hazard analysis, including documenting that the hazard analysis 
was conducted by a qualified individual. You have not demonstrated 
compliance with this requirement. Specifically, during the inspection you provided 
copies of hazard analyses that were conducted by your foreign 
suppliers for the fresh bananas and fresh soursop that you 
imported from (b)(4), located in (b)(4), and for the fresh 
hot peppers that you imported from (b)(4), located in the 
(b)(4). Our investigator asked if you had reviewed these hazard 
analyses and you responded that you received handwritten copies and 
had transcribed them. However, you did not provide documentation that 
you reviewed and assessed your foreign supplier’s hazard analysis, including 
whether it was conducted by a qualified individual, as required 
by 21 CFR 1.504(d). 3. You did not document that 
you conducted an evaluation of the supplier’s performance and the 
risk posed by the food, in accordance with 21 CFR 
1.505(a), and document your approval of your foreign supplier on 
the basis of that evaluation, as required by 21 CFR 
1.505(b). During the inspection, a representative of your firm stated 
that you do not have any evaluation procedures or documentation 
showing that you evaluated fresh soursop and fresh bananas imported 
from (b)(4) in (b)(4) and fresh hot pepper imported from 
(b)(4) in the (b)(4). Our investigator asked you how you 
evaluate your suppliers and explained key requirements of the Standards 
for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for 
Human Consumption (21 CFR part 112). You stated that in 
the past, you would visit your suppliers, but you have 
not done so in 10 years. You stated you are 
aware that your foreign suppliers (b)(4) and do not (b)(4), 
and you received test records from your suppliers (b)(4). As 
part of your response on August 8, 2022, you included 
a Laboratory Test Report (b)(4) from (b)(4) and a (b)(4) 
report from (b)(4), as well as a (b)(4) for hot 
peppers from (b)(4). You further explained that you request a 
(b)(4) from your suppliers every (b)(4), which you review for 
any changes in production process or changes in appearance of 
the product. To the extent that the (b)(4) and test 
reports you described and provided are part of your evaluation 
of your suppliers, you did not document your evaluation of 
each foreign supplier’s performance and the risk posed by the 
food in accordance with 21 CFR 1.505(a)(2), and you did 
not document your approval, as required by 21 CFR 1.505(b). 
4. You did not meet the requirements to perform foreign 
supplier verification activities in accordance with 21 CFR 1.506 for 
the products you import. Specifically, you did not document your 
determination or performance of appropriate foreign supplier verification activities for 
fresh soursop and fresh bananas that you import from (b)(4) 
located in (b)(4) or for fresh hot peppers that you 
import from (b)(4) located in the (b)(4). During the inspection, 
you explained that about every (b)(4), you request that (b)(4) 
and (b)(4) provide you with (b)(4) the production process which 
you review for any changes to the production process or 
changes in appearance of the product. You also provided, as 
part of your response dated August 8, 2022, a Laboratory 
Test Report for (b)(4) from (b)(4) and a (b)(4) report 
and (b)(4) for hot peppers from (b)(4). Although these videos 
and reports may provide information relevant to verification activities, you 
did not include any description of audit procedures or conclusions, 
or indicate that the applicable FDA food safety regulations were 
considered. Furthermore, you did not establish written procedures for ensuring 
that appropriate supplier verification activities are conducted in accordance with 
21 CFR 1.506(b), and you did not document your determination 
of the appropriate supplier verification activity in accordance with 21 
CFR 1.506(d). The above violations are not intended to be 
an all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. It 
is your responsibility to ensure that you are in compliance 
with section 805 of the FD&C Act and the implementing 
regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L. This letter 
notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity 
to address them. If you do not adequately address this 
matter, we may take further action. For instance, we may 
take action under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the food you import 
for which you appear to be in violation of section 
805. We may place the foods you import into the 
United States on detention without physical examination (DWPE) when you 
import the foods. You can find DWPE information relating to 
FSVP in Import Alert # 99-41 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, 
the importation or offering for importation into the United States 
of an article of food without the importer having an 
FSVP that meets the requirements of section 805 of the 
FD&C Act or the FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 
301(zz) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(zz)). Additionally, we 
offer the following comments: During the inspection, you provided hazard 
analyses that were conducted by your foreign suppliers for the 
fresh bananas and fresh soursop that you imported from (b)(4), 
located in (b)(4), and for the fresh hot peppers that 
you imported from (b)(4), located in the (b)(4). To the 
extent you intend to use these hazard analyses to comply 
with FSVP requirements, when you conduct and document your review 
and assessment per 21 CFR 1.504(d), we recommend that you 
also obtain and maintain documentation from your supplier, (b)(4), of 
information that demonstrates that their described activity of (b)(4) is 
sufficient as a control for Pseudococcidae (Mealybug) without introducing any 
new risk factors (such as internalization – the introduction of 
foodborne pathogens into edible parts of fresh produce), as well 
as supplier documentation of controls used to ensure that the 
(b)(4) met the specified criteria throughout the treatment period. If, 
as stated, your supplier is using (b)(4), then periodic (e.g., 
annual) documentation that attests to the supplier’s (b)(4) quality would 
also be needed. Additionally, regarding your supplier’s described use of 
pressure washing, especially if performed at (b)(4), such pressure has 
the potential to spread contamination widely throughout the immediate use 
area. Further, this practice could damage the integrity of the 
produce commodity’s skin which also could introduce pathogen contamination. We 
recommend that you evaluate the appropriateness of using such high 
pressure to wash the produce, including consideration of how the

641057 


Dear Steven Haynes: This letter is to advise you 
that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your 
websites at www.cedarcreekdistributors.com, www.thriftmasterholdings.com, and https://apelindx.com in November 2022 and 
has determined that you take orders there for various products, 
which you represent as containing cannabidiol (CBD).1 We have also 
reviewed your social media websites at www.instagram.com/thriftmasterholdings and www.facebook.com/thriftmasterholdings, which 
are accessible from your website www.thriftmasterholdings.com, where consumers can purchase 
your products. The claims on your websites and social media 
accounts establish that your products, “ApelinDx metered dose inhaler,” “Maia 
CBD Tincture Inhaler,” “Maia CBD Oil,” “Maia Dried Mango Slices,” 
“Maia Dried Pineapple Chunks,” “Maia Gummies,” and “CBD Pill” (hereinafter 
referred to as “your CBD products”), are unapproved new drugs 
introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation 
of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). 
In addition, these products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of 
the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). FDA has also determined 
that your “Maia Dried Mango Slices,” “Maia Dried Pineapple Chunks,” 
and “Maia Gummies” food products are adulterated within the meaning 
of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), 
because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, 
it is a prohibited act to introduce your “Maia Dried 
Mango Slices,” “Maia Dried Pineapple Chunks,” and “Maia Gummies” products 
into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 
21 U.S.C. 331(ll). Consumers may confuse these products with traditional 
foods; therefore, with these products there is a risk of 
unintended consumption of CBD. As explained further below, introducing or 
delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the 
FD&C Act. You can find specific information about how FDA 
regulates cannabis-derived products at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd. We also observed that your 
website, www.thriftmasterholdings.com, and social media websites make claims that your 
CBD products may be intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, 
or cure COVID-19 in people. FDA is taking urgent measures 
to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or 
authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or 
cure COVID-19 in people.2 As described below, you sell products 
that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure 
COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action 
to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products 
for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19. 
Furthermore, your “ApelinDx metered dose inhaler” and “Maia CBD Tincture 
Inhaler” products are intended to deliver CBD through oral inhalation. 
These products are particularly concerning to the agency because the 
ingredients and potential impurities in oral inhalation sprays may trigger 
laryngospasm and bronchospasm and may be toxic to the tissues 
in the upper or lower airways. Inhalation products that are 
intended to act locally in the respiratory system also may 
be absorbed and exert undesirable systemic effects, such as increased 
heart rate or elevated blood pressure. Unapproved New Drugs Based 
on a review of your websites and social media websites, 
your CBD products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for 
use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of 
disease, and/or intended to affect the structure or any function 
of the body. Examples of claims from your websites and 
social media websites that provide evidence of the intended use 
of these products as drugs include, but may not be 
limited to, the following: On your “About Us” webpage https://cedarcreekdistributors.com/about-us/: 
On your “We’re in the News” hyperlink https://thriftmasterholdings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/USA-today-AD-compressed-7.15.21.pdf accessed through 
your website www.thriftmasterholdings.com: On your “CBD Helps” hyperlink https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/mcog-chr101620.php accessed 
through your website www.thriftmasterholdings.com: On your Instagram social media website 
www.instagram.com/thriftmasterholdings: On your Facebook social media website www.facebook.com/thriftmasterholdings: Additionally, your 
website https://apelindx.com hyperlinks to a news report discussing the use 
of CBD to delay the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. The 
news report shows an image of a product that states 
“ApelinDx” on the label and appears to be a metered 
dose inhaler. Your CBD products are not generally recognized as 
safe and effective (GRASE) for their above referenced uses and, 
therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of 
the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not 
applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or 
delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from 
FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There are no 
FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products. 
Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation 
of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 
U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d). Misbranded Drugs Your CBD products are 
misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C 
Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to 
bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means 
directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely 
and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 
21 CFR 201.5.) Your CBD products are offered for conditions 
that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals 
who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, adequate directions for use 
cannot be written so that a layperson can use these 
drugs safely for their intended purposes. Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) 
and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling 
are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions 
for use by a layperson. However, your products are not 
exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions 
for use because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for 
these products. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate 
commerce of misbranded drugs is prohibited under section 301(a) of 
the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). 301(ll) and Adulterated Human 
Foods According to your product labeling, your “Maia Dried Mango 
Slices,” “Maia Dried Pineapple Chunks,” and “Maia Gummies” products are 
foods to which CBD has been added. However, you should 
be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 
301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce 
or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to 
which has been added a drug approved under section 505 
of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations 
have been instituted and for which the existence of such 
investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA 
has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to 
CBD.3 There is an exception if the substance was marketed 
in food before the drug was approved or before the 
substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, 
based on the available evidence, FDA has concluded that this 
is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware 
of any evidence that would call into question its current 
conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
331(ll), prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food 
to which CBD has been added, but you may present 
FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue. You should 
also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of 
the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term “food additive” 
refers to any substance the intended use of which results 
in it becoming a component of any food, unless the 
substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts 
under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the 
substance meets a listed exception.4 Food additives require premarket approval 
based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has 
not been approved for its intended use in food is 
deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C 
Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the food to be 
adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is 
prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
331(a). There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the 
use of CBD. We are not aware of any information 
to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior 
sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not 
aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS 
for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 
170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a 
food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance 
may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for 
a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based 
on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30). We 
know of no basis for general recognition of safety for 
CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in 
food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review 
of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not 
provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of 
CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some 
of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm 
from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with 
the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review 
of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from 
CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, 
studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with 
the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone 
levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on 
our review, the use of CBD in your products does 
not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 
170.30. FDA is not aware of any other exception to 
the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for 
use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD 
added to a conventional food is a food additive under 
section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to 
the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under 
section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it 
is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to 
marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional 
food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning 
of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 
402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your “Maia Dried Mango 
Slices,” “Maia Dried Pineapple Chunks,” and “Maia Gummies” products are 
adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C 
Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. 
Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited 
under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

United States United States 


Dear Ms. Henretty: The Center for 
Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
has reviewed your submissions to the FDA and our inspection 
records, and determined that Vapor E-Cigarette, L.L.C. manufactures and distributes 
e-liquid products for commercial distribution in the United States, and 
that the e-liquid products are manufactured and offered for sale 
or distribution to customers in the United States. Under section 
201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C 
Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products 
because they are components or parts of products made or 
derived from tobacco or contain nicotine from any source and 
intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, 
are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 
1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the 
requirements in the FD&C Act. Please be aware that, on 
March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the 
FD&C Act to extend FDA’s jurisdiction to products “containing nicotine 
from any source,” not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title 
I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of 
“tobacco product” under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any 
source. Tobacco products, including e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any 
source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and 
its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14. Generally, 
to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C 
Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization 
in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product 
that was not commercially marketed in the United States as 
of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that 
was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of 
the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing 
authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product 
unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report 
under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially 
equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the 
FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under 
section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) 
and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements 
of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)). A New Tobacco 
Product Without Required Marketing Authorization Is Adulterated and Misbranded FDA 
has determined that you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to customers 
in the United States vapor’s BREW e-liquid product without a 
marketing authorization order. The e-liquid product listed above is a 
new tobacco product because it was not commercially marketed in 
the United States as of February 15, 2007. This product 
does not have an FDA marketing authorization order in effect 
under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and is not 
otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, this product 
is adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, it is misbranded under section 
903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because 
a notice or other information respecting this product was not 
provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. 
The doing of any act with respect to a tobacco 
product while such article is held for sale after shipment 
in interstate commerce which results in such product being adulterated 
or misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, to the 
extent that a report was required under section 905(j) of 
the FD&C Act, the failure to provide such report is 
a prohibited act under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 331(p)). Conclusion and Requested Actions FDA has 
not received an application from your firm requesting marketing authorization 
for the product listed in this Warning Letter. This product 
and any other new tobacco product on the market without 
the statutorily required premarket authorization are adulterated and misbranded and 
are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. It is 
your responsibility to ensure that all of your tobacco products 
comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and 
FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter IX, 
relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 
C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory 
action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, 
and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written 
notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. 
Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the 
United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may 
be detained or refused admission. The violations discussed in this 
letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should 
take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced 
above, as well as violations that are the same as 
or similar to the ones stated above, and take any 
necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with 
the FD&C Act. Please submit a written response to this 
letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt 
describing your actions to address any violations and bring your 
products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued 
the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and 
your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If 
you believe that your products are not in violation of 
the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information 
for our consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings 
and provides you with an opportunity to address them. You 
can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s homepage

Springs, FL 34134 United States United States 


Dear Mr. Hannon: 
The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions to the FDA 
and our inspection records, and determined that Vape King Inc. 
manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for commercial distribution in the 
United States, and that the e-liquid products are manufactured and 
offered for sale or distribution to customers in the United 
States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products 
are tobacco products because they are made or derived from 
tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including 
e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 
C.F.R. § 1100.1. Therefore, these products are required to be 
in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act. Please 
be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional 
products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories 
to these newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation 
under the FD&C Act. These products include, but are not 
limited to, electronic nicotine delivery systems (including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), 
cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products 
To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco 
Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco 
Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. 
Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. The FD&C 
Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization 
in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product 
that was not commercially marketed in the United States as 
of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that 
was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of 
the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing 
authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product 
unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report 
under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially 
equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the 
FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under 
section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) 
and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements 
of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)). A New Tobacco 
Product Without Required Marketing Authorization Is Adulterated and Misbranded FDA 
has determined that you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to customers 
in the United States Vape King Blue Raspberry 3mg e-liquid 
product without a marketing authorization order. The tobacco product listed 
above is a new tobacco product because it was not 
commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 
2007. This product does not have an FDA marketing authorization 
order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act 
and is not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. 
Therefore, this product is adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, it is 
misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting this 
product was not provided as required by section 905(j) of 
the FD&C Act. The doing of any act with respect 
to a tobacco product while such article is held for 
sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such 
product being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited act under 
section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). 
Additionally, to the extent that a report was required under 
section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure to provide 
such report is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)). Conclusion and Requested 
Actions All new tobacco products on the market without the 
statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject 
to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. Products for which no 
application is pending, including, for example, those with a Marketing 
Denial Order and those for which no application was submitted, 
are among our highest enforcement priorities. For information on how 
FDA intends to prioritize enforcement resources with regard to the 
marketing of certain adulterated and misbranded ENDS and other deemed 
new tobacco products, please refer to the FDA’s guidance titled 
Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) and Other 
Deemed Products on the Market Without Premarket Authorization, available at 
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market. It is your responsibility to ensure that all of 
your tobacco products comply with each applicable provision of the 
FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any 
violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et 
seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products including the tobacco 
regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may 
lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil 
money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does 
not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of 
the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for 
import into the United States that appear to be adulterated 
and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission. The violations 
discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive 
list. You should take prompt action to address any violations

States United States 


Dear Michael A. Witynski: The United States 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility, Family Dollar 
Distribution Inc., located at 1800 Family Dollar Parkway, West Memphis, 
AR 72301 from January 11, 2022 through February 11, 2022. 
Your facility holds and distributes various human foods, including dietary 
supplements; animal foods; cosmetics; over-the-counter drugs (OTC drugs); and devices. 
Based on the inspectional findings, we have identified serious violations 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) 
and applicable regulations. Under section 301(a) of the Act [21 
U.S.C. § 331(a), the introduction or delivery for introduction into 
interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that 
is adulterated is a prohibited act. Further, it is a 
prohibited act under section 301(k) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 
§ 331(k)] to do any act with respect to a 
food, drug, device, or cosmetic, if such act is done 
while the products are held for sale after shipment in 
interstate commerce and results in the products being adulterated. You 
can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on 
the FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov. We acknowledge your firm 
initiated a voluntary recall of certain products regulated by the 
FDA that were stored and shipped to 404 stores from 
Family Dollar Distribution Inc., in West Memphis, Arkansas from January 
1, 2021 through March 18, 2022 due to the presence 
of rodents and rodent activity at the Family Dollar Distribution 
Center. At the close of the inspection, you were issued 
a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, dated February 11, 2022. 
FDA received your written responses to those observations on March 
7; March 22; April 8; May 6; June 10; July 
15; August 19; and September 30, 2022. In your May 
6, 2022, letter, you state that you are permanently closing 
the facility. We have reviewed your responses and we discuss 
your significant violations and your corrective actions below. Adulterated Human 
Foods and Dietary Supplements The inspection of your facility revealed 
serious violations of FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice, 
Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Foods under 
Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR 
Part 117). These violations cause your human food and dietary 
supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 
402(a)(3) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(3)] in that 
your products consist in whole or in part of any 
filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or if it is otherwise 
unfit for food and section 402(a)(4) of the Act [21 
U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)] in that they have been prepared, packed, 
or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become 
contaminated with filth, or whereby they may have been rendered 
injurious to health. 1. You did not take effective measures 
to exclude pests from your holding areas and to protect 
against contamination of food on the premises by pests as 
required by 21 CFR 117.35(c). Specifically, our investigators observed evidence 
of rodent activity, including live rodents, dead rodents in various 
states of decay, rodent excreta pellets (REPs) in numbers too 
numerous to count (TNTC), gnaw marks in food and food 
packaging, nesting material, and odors indicative of rodent infestation throughout 
the entire facility including areas where human food, including dietary 
supplements, are routinely stored. Below are some examples of the 
observations made by the investigators: • Four rat carcasses on 
the conveyer belt along the south wall of your facility 
by aisles (b)(4) and (b)(4) • Significant gnawings, REPs TNTC, 
and a strong odor of rodent urine and excreta on 
a pallet containing (b)(4) cases of mixed nuts stored in 
rack location (b)(4). Multiple bags of product were gnawed open, 
and product was spilling out of cases onto lower levels 
of the pallet. Gnawings and spilled product could be seen 
from the top (b)(4) layer down to the 3rd layer 
of the pallet. • REP and (b)(7)(E) hair on top 
of a pallet of Vitamin C 1000 mg dietary supplements. 
• Approximately 15 REPs on a pallet of flour located 
in rack location (b)(4). Eleven of the (b)(4) cases stored 
on the pallet contained product with gnawings. While investigators unstacked 
the pallet, two mice exited from gnawed-open product bags stacked 
on the bottom layer of the pallet and ran west 
under the north end of aisle (b)(4). • Approximately 30 
REPs in and around a pallet containing (b)(4) cardboard cases 
with twelve 5.6-ounce pouches of Chicken Flavor Rice & Pasta 
Blend product stored in rack location (b)(4). This pallet also 
had nesting material and tunnelling in between the bottom layers 
1 and 2 of the pallet and at the top 
((b)(4)) layer. Approximately 20 of the cases on the pallet 
contained significant rodent gnawings. • Four rats crossing aisle (b)(4) 
from east to west near the south side of the 
aisle and two more rats crossing aisle (b)(4) from west 
to east near the south side of the aisle. Food 
is stored along the entirety of the floor levels of 
aisles (b)(4). • At least 5 rats were noted in 
rack location (b)(4), which is in the northeast corner of 
one of the two food storage areas in your facility. 
Rats were climbing through the pallet in this rack location 
and climbing up rack scaffolding to reach upper levels. • 
A strong foul odor/stench of dead and decaying rodents, rodent 
pellets, and evidence of rodents nesting in and around the 
Inventory Control Center (ICC) and the breakroom, which is located 
directly north of food aisles (b)(4). According to firm management, 
the General Manager closed the ICC and breakroom in October 
2021 because of complaints related to strong odors associated with 
dead rodents. Inspectors observed that the ICC was cleared out 
and closed off, and a putrid odor continued to permeate 
the room. The breakroom above the ICC was closed and 
rodent nesting materials were in front of the entrance. • 
Apparent bird droppings were observed on chocolate protein shakes and 
Vitamin C supplement drops and on the floor near the 
northeast side of the small food storage racks by the 
shipping area ((b)(4) and (b)(4), respectively). • Two dead birds 
were observed within the facility. One bird was caught in 
netting hung from the roof above pallets of breakfast cereals. 
The second was observed on the east side of the 
mezzanine level under part of the old conveyor system. In 
addition to visual observations, FDA documented the following findings: • 
FDA collected several samples during the inspection. These samples included 
human food products (samples 1124522, 1179824, and 1179931) and an 
animal food product (sample 1176277), product packaging, and a filth 
sample (sample 1176276). These samples were submitted to FDA labs 
for analysis. FDA’s analysis found the presence of urine, gnaw 
marks in the packaging, rodent hairs, and/or REPs in these 
samples. Further, the filth sample included REPs and nesting materials 
collected from all four corners and the center of the 
warehouse (including the center of each of the two food 
areas), demonstrating the rodent population was throughout the facility. • 
FDA conducted a review of your pest control records. Reports 
from your pest control company documented the capture of between 
16 and 107 rodents for all months of 2020 and 
January – June of 2021. In addition, your maintenance team 
conducted additional monitoring and tracking of rodent captures made in 
large bait boxes and glue traps placed by your pest 
control company along the pick-slot level of aisles (b)(4). Between 
the dates of March 29, 2021 to September 17, 2021, 
your firm documented over 2300 rodent captures. Following a facility 
fumigation between January 16 - January 20, 2022, approximately 1100 
rodent carcasses were “harvested” or removed from your facility by 
firm employees and your pest control company. • According to 
internal emails reviewed during the inspection, your firm was contacted 
by stores as far back as December 8, 2020, sharing 
their observations of rodent activity in deliveries of food products 
from the distribution center. Specifically, throughout 2021, retail stores serviced 
by the West Memphis distribution center emailed complaints of receiving 
food products gnawed by rodents, nesting materials inside of packages, 
and case containing both live and dead rodents from the 
distribution center. 2. You did not maintain buildings, fixtures, and 
other physical facilities of your plant in a clean and 
sanitary condition and in repair adequate to prevent food from 
becoming adulterated as required by 21 CFR 117.35(a). Specifically, insanitary 
conditions were observed throughout your facility demonstrating that sanitation and 
cleaning operations were not conducted in a manner that protects 
against contamination of food. These insanitary conditions provided food sources 
and pest harborage areas for rodents and other pests. In 
addition, inadequate maintenance to parts of the facility allowed for 
potential pest entry and harborage areas within the facility. The 
following are examples of insanitary conditions that were observed: • 
Investigators observed spilled breakfast cereal, spilled Chicken Flavor Rice & 
Pasta Blend product, spilled all-purpose flour, spilled popcorn, and spilled 
sunflower seeds. All products had REPs mixed in with spilled 
product. Fluorescing stains were observed in and around the packaging 
for spilled flour and popcorn. • Accumulations of trash and 
debris in multiple locations, including the old conveyor system located 
in the mezzanine level and in the “Junk Yard” portion 
of the warehouse, which contains maintenance equipment. • Open packages 
of baby wipes were observed in the warehouse with fluorescent 
stains indicative of urea or urine. • Following the fumigation 
of the facility, the inadequate sanitation practices became more apparent 
as dead pests were observed in various states of decay 
throughout the facility. These observations included, but are not limited 
to: o Multiple dead rodents found near slots (b)(4) and 
#(b)(4). o Dead rodents along the north wall, near the 
ICC and breakroom, on March 7, 2022. One was caught 
in a snap trap zip tied to a metal beam 
next to dock door (b)(4) and the other was behind 
a metal beam against the outer wall. o A dead 
bird below part of the old conveyor system on March 
7, 2022. The following are examples of inadequate maintenance conditions 
that were observed: • Gaps were found along the top 
of the compactor that is meant to create a seal 
between the compactor and the exterior wall of the facility. 
Additionally, holes were observed in the compactor sidewall ranging from 
an estimated 1 inch to 12 inches on both the 
north and south facing sides allowing for potential pest entry. 
The compactor has a (b)(4) door for access from the 
inside of the firm that is left open during business 
hours. While this door is open, the gaps and holes 
present the potential for pest entry into the facility. • 
Multiple dock doors were observed to have gaps allowing for 
potential entry of pests into the facility. More specifically, receiving 
doors (b)(4) and (b)(4) had gaps up to 3 inches 
in length and 1 inch in height around the doors, 
and receiving doors (b)(4), (b)(4) and (b)(4) were observed to 
have gaps at least 2 inches in height and 6 
inches in length. Shipping doors (b)(4) and (b)(4) were observed 
to have approximately 2-inch gaps running the entirety of each 
side of the dock plates. • Your firm began the 
decommissioning of a conveyor system. Parts of the decommissioned system 
were left in the mezzanine level where cobwebs, dirt, dust, 
and debris has built up under and around these parts. 
This equipment became a harborage area for rodents as evidenced 
by the observation of a dead rodent that was seen 
in between the conveyor belts of the “Upper West Side 
Belt” and investigators noting a foul odor indicative of dead 
and decaying animals in another section of what would be 
the “Upper Southside Belt.” 3. You did not keep grounds 
around your plant in a condition that would protect against 
the contamination of food as required by 21 CFR 117.20(a). 
Specifically, you did not properly store equipment, remove litter and 
waste, and cut weeds or grass within the immediate vicinity 
of the plant that may constitute an attractant, breeding place, 
or harborage for pests, as required by 21 CFR 117.20(a)(1). 
For example, throughout the inspection, FDA investigators observed the following 
conditions: • Large amounts of trash (including food trash), wood 
from pallets, and debris were piled below dock doors and 
along the shipping and receiving area walls of the facility. 
• Piled-up trash extending approximately 2 feet out from the 
walls of the facility. • Large amounts of food trash 
and dirt piled below and surrounding the compacter that appeared 
to have spilled from a breach in the side panel 
of the compactor. • Throughout the inspection, piles of food 
next to or spilling out of the large open-top dumpsters 
located on the west side of the shipping dock. Adulterated 
Cosmetics 4. The cosmetic products that you hold and distribute 
are adulterated within the meaning of section 601(c) of the 
Act [21 U.S.C. § 361(c)] in that they have been 
prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may 
have become contaminated with filth, or whereby they may have 
been rendered injurious to health. Specifically, during the January 11, 
2022 to February 11, 2022 inspection of your West Memphis, 
Arkansas facility, our investigators observed insanitary conditions that may cause 
your cosmetic products to be contaminated with filth or rendered 
injurious to health. Specifically, there was apparent filth and evidence 
of rodent activity throughout the warehouse, and the equipment and 
facility are not maintained to prevent the contamination of the 
cosmetic products. For example, our investigators observed the following: • 
Rodent excreta pellets on and around cosmetic products stored in 
your facility. • Multiple dock doors and dock plates in 
both shipping and receiving areas with gaps ranging in size 
exposing the facility to the environment. • Multiple holes in 
rubber sealants and gaps surrounding pipes and wiring exiting the 
building. • Heavy buildup of dust and debris around and 
under pallets storing cosmetic products. Adulterated Animal Foods The inspection 
of your facility revealed evidence of significant violations of FDA’s 
regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based 
Preventive Controls for Food for Animals under Title 21, Code 
of Federal Regulations, Part 507 (21 CFR 507). These violations 
cause your animal food products to be adulterated under section 
402(a)(3) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(3)] in that 
your products consist in whole or in part of any 
filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or if they are otherwise 
unfit for food and under section 402(a)(4) of the Act 
[21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)] in that they have been prepared, 
packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have 
become contaminated with filth, or whereby they may have been 
rendered injurious to health. 5. Your firm failed to hold 
animal food for distribution under conditions that protect against contamination 
and minimize deterioration in accordance with 21 CFR 507.27(a). Specifically, 
during the inspection, investigators documented insanitary conditions in the area 
of your warehouse where bagged pet foods are stored. The 
insanitary conditions observed by our investigators include significant rodent activity, 
such as gnaw holes in packaging material, rodent excreta pellets, 
nesting materials, urine stains, live rodents, and rodent carcasses. These 
conditions were observed in the center of each of the 
(b)(4) food areas of your warehouse, consisting of aisles (b)(4) 
and (b)(4). These conditions were also observed in all four 
corners and the center of the warehouse. 6. Your firm 
failed to take effective measures to exclude pests and protect 
animal foods from contamination by pests as required by 21 
CFR 507.19(e). Specifically, your firm’s failures at preventing, controlling, and 
mitigating an active rodent infestation were described under the human 
foods observations 1-2 above. The animal foods stored and distributed 
at your warehouse were under the same conditions and exposed 
to the same insanitary conditions as the human food products. 
The extent of the rodent activity in the facility was 
documented through the collection of a filth sample (1176276) which 
included REPs and nesting material from all four corners of 
the warehouse that confirmed the presence of rodents throughout the 
warehouse. Additional observations or findings by FDA Investigators of rodent 
activity in and around animal food products include the following: 
• Rodent gnawings on seven out of (b)(4) bags of 
High Protein Chicken & Turkey Flavored dog food stored on 
a pallet in rack location (b)(4) on the southwest corner 
of food area (b)(4) This pallet also contained TNTC apparent 
REPs on and around the bags of dog food. • 
Approximately 40 REPs on a pallet containing (b)(4) bundles of 
four 3.15-pound bags of Tender & Crunchy Combo cat food 
stored in rack location (b)(4) One of the 3.15-pound bags 
also contained a circular gnaw-hole approximately 1.5 inches in diameter. 
• TNTC REPs on and around a pallet containing (b)(4) 
16-pound bags of Gravy Style Beef Flavored dog food held 
in rack location (b)(4) • TNTC REPs on a pallet 
containing (b)(4) twelve-pound bags of Surfin’ & Turfin’ Favorites dry 
cat food stored in rack location (b)(4). Three bags on 
the lowest layer of the pallet also contained gnaw holes 
ranging from 2 inches to 4 inches in diameter. FDA 
sample 1176277 of Surfin’ & Turfin animal food, collected on 
January 13, 2022, included the product, its packaging, and REPs 
was submitted for analysis. The FDA lab determined that the 
submitted product had urine stains and rodent hairs, the packaging 
had rodent gnawings and urine stains, and the REPs were 
determined to be of rodent origin. In addition to the 
rodent infestation, investigators documented the presence of birds in and 
around the animal foods. Specifically, on February 1, 2022, apparent 
bird droppings covering an area of flooring 1.5 foot wide, 
and 3 feet long were observed by the northwest end 
of aisle (b)(4). On February 9, 2022, investigators observed new 
bird droppings covering the same area. Aisle (b)(4) is primarily 
used for storage of pallets containing large bags of animal 
food. In addition to the bird droppings, a dead bird 
was observed caught in bird netting overtop of this area. 
Adulterated Human Drugs During our January 11 to February 11, 
2022 inspection of your facility investigators from the FDA determined 
that your firm holds and distributes OTC drug products that 
are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the 
Act [21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)] in that the building used in 
the holding of drug products was not maintained in a 
clean and sanitary condition and was infested by rodents and 
other vermin as required by 21 CFR 211.56(a). The drug 
products held at your facility were also adulterated under 501(a)(2)(A) 
of the Act [21 U.S.C, 351(a)(2)(A)] in that the drug 
products were prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby 
they may have been contaminated with filth or rendered injurious 
to health. 7. During the inspection, our investigator observed filthy 
conditions in your facility. We observed significant rodent activity throughout 
the facility. We observed dead rodents and birds in various 
areas inside your facility, rodent urine and feces in and 
on several pallets containing drug products, and pungent odors in 
various areas inside your facility. As you are aware, rodents 
are disease vectors and goods contaminated with rodent feces and/or 
urine may cause Salmonella and other infectious diseases. Infants, children, 
pregnant women, the elderly, and immunocompromised persons are at greatest 
risk for infection and are more likely to have severe 
symptoms. Consumers can become infected by handling contaminated drugs, including 
packaging, and then transferring the bacteria from their hands to 
their mouth. Additionally, Salmonella on hands or clothes can spread 
the bacteria to other people, objects, and surfaces. 8. Products 
stored at your facility, including adulterated drug products, were shipped 
to 404 Family Dollar retail stores after being held in 
the above-mentioned conditions. You were aware of a rodent infestation 
at your facility beginning in 2020, and you continued to 
ship products, including drug products, to stores up until January 
13, 2022 when fumigation of the facility occurred. Adulterated Devices 
During the inspection of your distribution center, investigators from the 
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that your 
firm holds and distributes devices, including but not limited to, 
tampons, face masks, contact lens solutions, adhesive bandages, and pregnancy 
tests. Under section 201(h) of the Act, [21 U.S.C. § 
321(h)], these products are devices because they are intended for 
use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or 
in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or 
to affect the structure or any function of the body. 
The devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(A) 
of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(A)], because they have 
been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they 
may have been rendered injurious to health. 9. Specifically, the 
devices held at your distribution center were exposed to significant 
rodent infestation and rodent excreta pellets. Investigators documented signs of 
rodent gnawing, and nesting material associated with long term rodent 
presence throughout the facility where the devices were held. The 
conditions described above for foods and drugs reflect the general 
objectionable conditions of the warehouse under which you also held 
devices regulated by FDA. Additionally, evidence of rodent contamination directly 
to devices was observed. For example: • On February 2, 
2022, FDA investigators observed a pallet of Family Wellness Pregnancy 
Tests, lot W00101202, located in bay (b)(4) with numerous rodent 
excreta pellets on the top of and in between cases 
along with nesting material and fluorescing stains. • On February 
1, 2022, FDA investigators observed a case of First Response 
Pregnancy Tests, expiration date 2022-12-23, located in the repack area 
with a rodent excreta pellet and apparent rodent hairs on 
top of the boxes. We acknowledge that your firm conducted 
a voluntary recall of FDA-regulated devices warehoused at the West 
Memphis Distribution Center, RES89685, on February 18, 2022; and is 
conducting ongoing destruction activities of these products within your control. 
The FDA requests that you include in subsequent responses any 
ongoing or future corrective actions your firm is implementing specific 
to these products. Further, we request your firm provides records 
demonstrating the effectiveness of your corrective actions taken to reduce 
the presence of rodents, and other pests, in your distribution 
warehouse, including records of ongoing rodent control activities, such as 
capture numbers and their locations in your subsequent responses. Additional 
Considerations Your corporation received a Warning Letter (320-20-071 sent to 
Greenbrier International Inc. doing business as Dollar Tree (FEI 3005269673)) 
on November 6, 2019, for the receipt and delivery or 
proffered delivery of adulterated drugs in violation of section 301(c) 
of the Act, [21 U.S.C. § 331(c)]. Of particular concern, 
the Warning Letter detailed FDA evidence that Dollar Tree, parent 
company of Family Dollar, distributed drugs that were manufactured at 
a facility where rodent feces were found throughout.2 In light 
of these two separate incidents involving significant rodent infestations in 
your supply chain, we recommend that Family Dollar take steps 
to evaluate whether there are additional issues with rodent infestation 
in your drug supply chain. Cessation of Preparing, Packing or 
Holding FDA Regulated Articles for Distribution We acknowledge your decision 
to close the facility and cease distribution of all FDA 
regulated articles from the site. We reviewed your written responses 
dated March 7; March 22; April 8; May 6; June 
10; July 15; August 19; and September 30, 2022 but 
do not see a need to discuss your responses further 
in light of your decision to close the facility. If 
you plan to resume the preparing, packing or holding of 
FDA regulated articles for distribution at this facility, we request 
that you notify the FDA of your plans in writing. 
Remediating violations of the Act will be necessary if Family 
Dollar, a successor, or an acquirer resumes operations related to 
FDA regulated articles at this site. A meeting can be 
scheduled between you and the FDA to discuss the requirements. 
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement 
of violations that may exist in connection with your products. 
Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of any 
violations and take prompt actions to correct any violations and 
bring the products into compliance. It is your responsibility to 
ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal 
law, including FDA regulations. This letter notifies you of our 
concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure 
to adequately address this matter may result in legal action 
including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. Please notify FDA in 
writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, 
of the specific steps you have taken to address any 
violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to 
prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of 
related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 
working days, state the reason for the delay and the 
time within which you will do so. If you believe

TX 78577 United States United States 


Dear Mr. Martin, On 
June 30 and July 11, 2022, the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) conducted a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection 
of Nature’s Way Farms, LLC, located at 801 Bona Terra 
Drive, Suite 190, Pharr, TX 78577. We also conducted an 
inspection on October 21, 2020. These inspections were conducted to 
determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 
384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 CFR part 
1, subpart L. The FSVP regulation requires that importers perform 
certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or animal food 
they import into the United States has been produced in 
a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety standards. You 
may find information relating to the FSVP regulation and your 
responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links in FDA’s 
FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals. During the most recent inspection, 
we found that you are not in compliance with the 
requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart L for the 
foods from the foreign suppliers indicated in the attached list. 
Because of these significant violations, you are not in compliance 
with section 805 of the FD&C Act. At the conclusion 
of the most recent inspection, our investigator provided you with 
Form FDA 483a, FSVP Observations. We acknowledge receipt of your 
response to the FDA 483a, dated July 17, 2022, in 
which you stated that you have a consultant to develop 
your firm’s FSVP and you expect to have corrective actions 
by September 1, 2022. We are unable to evaluate the 
adequacy of your response because you have not provided any 
supporting documentation demonstrating your planned or completed corrective actions. To 
date, no additional FSVP documents beyond what you provided during 
the most recent inspection have been received by FDA. Your 
significant violations of the FSVP regulation are as follows: You 
did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP as required 
by section 805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 
1.502(a). Specifically, you did not develop an FSVP for the 
foods indicated in the attached list, including each of the 
following foods: • Fresh bell peppers imported from (b)(4) located 
in (b)(4) • Fresh avocados imported from (b)(4), located in 
(b)(4) The above violations are not intended to be an 
all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. It is 
your responsibility to ensure that you are in compliance with 
section 805 of the FD&C Act and the implementing regulation 
in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L. This letter notifies 
you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to 
address them. If you do not adequately address this matter, 
we may take further action. For instance, we may take 
action under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the food you import for 
which you appear to be in violation of section 805. 
We may place the foods from the identified foreign suppliers 
on detention without physical examination (DWPE) when you import the 
foods. You can find DWPE information relating to FSVP in 
Import Alert #99-41 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or 
offering for importation into the United States of an article 
of food without the importer having an FSVP that meets 
the requirements of section 805 of the FD&C Act or 
the FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(zz)). Additionally, we offer the following 
comments: You import fresh produce, which is “covered produce” as 
defined in 21 CFR 112.3. Your FSVP must demonstrate that 
your supplier is producing the food in compliance with processes 
and procedures that provide at least the same level of 
public health protection as those required under section 419 of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 350h) (regarding standards for produce 
safety) and the implementing regulations in the Standards for the 
Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption 
(21 CFR part 112). We also note that under 21 
CFR 1.509(a), for each line entry of food product offered 
for importation into the United States, you must ensure that 
your name, electronic mail address (i.e., email), and unique facility 
identifier (UFI) recognized as acceptable by FDA, identifying you as 
the importer of the food, are provided electronically when filing 
entry with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. As the owner 
or consignee of food that is being offered for import 
into the United States, you are the importer (see 21 
CFR 1.500). The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is 
the UFI that is recognized as acceptable by FDA. DUNS 
numbers are assigned and managed by Dun & Bradstreet. For 
your shipments of fresh bell peppers imported in entry HP7-0443728-1/41/1, 
fresh Persian cucumbers imported in entry HP7-0443470-0/21/1, and fresh avocados 
imported in entry HP7-0441435-5/11/1, you provided a DUNS number corresponding 
to your firm’s previous address and the email address associated 
with a third party. It is your responsibility to ensure 
that the required information under 21 CFR 1.509(a) is provided 
at the time of entry. You should respond in writing 
within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this 
letter. Your response should address the specific things you are 
doing to correct any violations. You should include in your 
response documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating 
your corrections (e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as 
a copy of your FSVP, records to demonstrate implementation of 
your FSVP), and any additional information that you wish to 
supply relevant to your compliance with the FSVP regulation. If 
you believe that you are not in violation of the 
FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for 
our consideration. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 
working days, you should explain the reason for your delay 
and state when you will correct any remaining violations. Please 
send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention:

de Caxias-RJ 25250-612 Brazil United States Warning Letter 320-23-07 December 
8, 2022 


Dear Mr. Mansur: The U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) inspected your drug manufacturing facility, Nortec Quimica SA, 
FEI 3007616930, at Rua Dezessete, 200, Distrito Industrial, Xerem, Duque 
de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro from July 18 to 22, 
2022. This warning letter summarizes significant deviations from current good 
manufacturing practice (CGMP) for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). Because your 
methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding 
do not conform to CGMP, your API are adulterated within 
the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). We reviewed 
your August 11, 2022, response to our Form FDA 483 
in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence. During 
our inspection, our investigator observed specific deviations including, but not 
limited to, the following. 1. Failure to exercise sufficient controls 
over computerized systems to prevent unauthorized access or changes to 
data, and failure to have adequate controls to prevent omission 
of data. Your firm did not have system security and 
access control over its electronic data and software systems. Your 
analysts had access to delete and overwrite data. Our investigator 
observed over 100 deleted files in the recycle bins on 
the infrared (IR) spectrophotometer computer and on the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) 
spectrophotometer computer. Specifically, multiple deleted analytical files had batch numbers 
in the filename and included files related to (b)(4) API, 
which your firm exports to the United States. The investigator 
also observed that the stand-alone computer systems for your UV-Vis 
and IR spectrophotometers failed to have usernames attributable to specific 
individuals, and instead used a common username. No password was 
required to sign into the Windows operating system, nor did 
the analytical software require any additional user log in. Further, 
you did not back up your stand-alone computers used to 
operate your UV-Vis and IR spectrophotometers. To ensure data integrity, 
actions performed must be attributable to a specific individual in 
your CGMP computer systems, and equipment should be appropriately controlled 
to prevent deletion and/or changes except by authorized personnel. In 
your response, you state you restricted access and permissions in 
the automated data system, implemented back-up practices for stand-alone computerized 
systems, and opened an investigation to review the content of 
the files found in the recycle bins. However, your response 
is inadequate because it does not address the overall lack 
of traceability of previous drug analyses, nor does it include 
a comprehensive strategy to confirm the validity of the previous 
analytical data used to release drugs. In addition, you also 
have not shown how these controls ensure that the records 
relied upon for batch release and other quality review decisions 
are complete and accurate. In your response to this letter, 
provide: • A comprehensive, third-party assessment and corrective action and 
preventive action (CAPA) plan for computer system security and integrity. 
Include a report that identifies vulnerabilities in the design and 
controls, and appropriate remediations for each of your laboratory computer 
systems. This should include, but not be limited to: o 
A list of all hardware that includes all equipment, both 
standalone and network, in your laboratory. o Identification of vulnerabilities 
in hardware, software, and non-networked systems (e.g., PLC). o A 
list of all software configurations (both equipment software and LIMS), 
details of all user privileges up to an including administrator 
rights, and oversight roles for each of your laboratory systems. 
Regarding user privileges, specify user roles and associated user privileges 
(including the specific permissions allowed for those with administrative privileges) 
for all staff levels who have access to the laboratory 
computer systems, and their organizational affiliation and title. o System 
security provisions, including but not limited to, whether unique usernames/passwords 
are always used, and their confidentiality safeguarded. o A detailed 
summary of your procedural updates and associated training for user 
role assignment and controls. o Your remediated program for ensuring 
strict ongoing control over electronic data to ensure that all 
additions, deletions, or modifications of information in your electronic records 
are authorized, and all data is retained. o Your remediated 
program for ensuring strict ongoing control over paper-based data to 
ensure that all additions, deletions, or modifications of information in 
your electronic records are authorized, and all data is retained. 
o Provisions for oversight from quality assurance (QA) managers, executives, 
and internal auditors with appropriate IT expertise (e.g., infrastructure; configuration; 
network requirements; segregation of duties including administrator rights). o An 
enhanced standard operating procedure (SOP) that ensures that all quality 
control tests, irrespective of whether captured in paper-based or electronic 
systems, are performed appropriately by an analyst, and receive second-tier 
review from a separate responsible (e.g., manager) individual. o Technological 
improvements to increase the integration of data generated through electronic 
systems from standalone equipment (e.g., balances, pH meters, water content 
testing) into the LIMS network. o Detailed procedures for your 
review of audit trail data. o Interim control measures and 
procedural changes for the control, review, and full retention of 
laboratory data. 2. Failure of your quality unit to review 
batch production records and laboratory control records prior to distribution 
of an API batch. Your quality unit (QU) failed to 
have well-defined processes or other sufficient control systems to ensure 
the adequate evaluation of batch related documentation before release of 
the API for distribution. Responsibilities of the Quality Unit Your 
QU did not review the complete record of the raw 
data generated during each test in the software for your 
chromatography system. For example, the QU did not review the 
spectra data in the system and applicable audit trails to 
ensure appropriate methods were used, the sequence was set up 
properly, and manual integration was performed adequately. In your response, 
you state that you plan to implement a process to 
perform the electronic review of the data generated by the 
chromatography software and perform a risk assessment of analytical data 
generated for the release and stability of the API commercially 
distributed in the United States in the last two years. 
However, your response is inadequate because it lacks sufficient details 
describing the process of how the electronic review of this 
existing data would be performed, such as whether the reviewer 
will evaluate the complete record of the raw data generated 
during each test from the chromatography systems in terms of 
chromatography methods, injection sequences, and system suitability. In addition, your 
response does not describe how the verification of the manual 
integration practices used during peak quantitation will be accomplished to 
ensure the adequate determination of the peak areas. Laboratory Control 
Records Your QU failed to ensure there are basic controls 
in place to prevent changes to your CGMP documentation. For 
example, the “analytical worksheet forms” used for recording testing results 
in the quality control (QC) laboratory are not controlled as 
there was no unique number, signature, or any other traceable 
element on the forms themselves to identify when or by 
whom it was issued. In your response, you state that 
you plan to implement a process to ensure the traceability 
of “analytical worksheet forms.” However, your response is inadequate because 
it did not provide sufficient details to describe the process 
of how these documents would be managed after they had 
been issued nor did you propose to investigate the overall 
lack of traceability for the previous drug analyses or perform 
a risk assessment to review the impact of incomplete analytical 
data records on your evaluation of API quality. Your QU 
must review all the raw data generated during each test 
and all the completed laboratory control records when making batch 
release decisions. In response to this letter, provide: • An 
overview of the controls you will implement to ensure that 
any manual integration steps are performed only under defined, limited 
circumstances according to a protocol approved and supervised by your 
QU. • A comprehensive review of all instances of chromatographic 
manual integration for your UV-Vis and IR spectrophotometers for U.S. 
marketed products within expiry. Provide scientific justification for the manual 
integration parameters you used for your analysis. For integrations that 
lacked scientific justification, provide your plan for reintegration with appropriate 
reintegration parameters. Assess whether reintegration results comply with your established 
API acceptance criteria. If out-of-specification (OOS) results are identified, provide 
the actions taken to ensure the quality of your drugs. 
• A reanalysis plan for all batches within retest dates 
that were released for U.S. marketed products within expiry. • 
A complete assessment of documentation systems used throughout your manufacturing 
and laboratory operations to determine where documentation practices are insufficient. 
Include a detailed CAPA plan that comprehensively remediates your firm’s 
documentation practices to ensure you retain attributable, legible, complete, original, 
accurate, contemporaneous records throughout your operation. Data Integrity Remediation Your 
quality system does not adequately ensure the accuracy and integrity 
of data to support the safety, effectiveness, and quality of 
the drugs you manufacture. See FDA’s guidance document Data Integrity 
and Compliance With Drug CGMP for guidance on establishing and 
following CGMP compliant data integrity practices at: https://www.fda.gov/files/drugs/published/Data-Integrity-and-Compliance-With-Current-Good-Manufacturing-Practice-Guidance-for-Industry.pdf. In response 
to this letter, provide: A. A comprehensive investigation into the 
extent of the inaccuracies in data records and reporting including 
results of the data review for drugs distributed to the 
United States. Include a detailed description of the scope and 
root causes of your data integrity lapses. B. A current 
risk assessment of the potential effects of the observed failures 
on the quality of your drugs. Your assessment should include 
analyses of the risks to patients caused by the release 
of drugs affected by a lapse of data integrity and 
analyses of the risks posed by ongoing operations. C. A 
management strategy for your firm that includes the details of 
your global CAPA plan. The detailed corrective action plan should 
describe how you intend to ensure the reliability and completeness 
of all data generated by your firm including microbiological and 
analytical data, manufacturing records, and all data submitted to FDA. 
CGMP Consultant Recommended Based upon the nature of the deviations 
we identified at your firm, you should engage a consultant 
qualified as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34 to assist 
your firm in meeting CGMP requirements. The qualified consultant should 
also perform a comprehensive audit of your entire operation for 
CGMP compliance and evaluate the completion and efficacy of your 
CAPAs before you pursue resolution of your firm’s compliance status 
with FDA. Conclusion The deviations cited in this letter are 
not intended to be an all-inclusive list of deviations that 
exist at your facility. You are responsible for investigating and 
determining the causes of any deviations and for preventing their 
recurrence or the occurrence of other deviations. Correct any deviations 
promptly. FDA may withhold approval of new applications or supplements 
listing your firm as a drug manufacturer until any deviations 
are completely addressed and we confirm your compliance with CGMP. 
We may re-inspect to verify that you have completed corrective 
actions to any deviations. Failure to address any deviations may 
also result in the FDA refusing admission of articles manufactured 
at Nortec Quimica SA, Rua Dezessete, 200, Distrito Industrial, Xerem, 
Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, into the United States 
under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3). 
Articles under this authority that appear to be adulterated may 
be detained or refused admission, in that the methods and 
controls used in their manufacture do not appear to conform 
to CGMP within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). This letter notifies you of 
our findings and provides you an opportunity to address the 
above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, respond to this 
office in writing within 15 working days1. Specify what you 
have done to address any deviations and to prevent their 
recurrence. In response to this letter, you may provide additional 
information for our consideration as we continue to assess your 
activities and practices. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 
15 working days, state your reasons for delay and your 
schedule for completion. Send your electronic reply to CDER-OC-OMQ-Communications@fda.hhs.gov. Identify 
your response with FEI 3007616930 and ATTN: Frank Wackes.

Refer to CMS 642790 


Dear Mr. Debertin: The North Dakota 
Department of Agriculture (NDDA), under U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) contract, conducted an inspection of your facility, consisting of 
a grain elevator and a non-FDA licensed, medicated feed mill, 
CHS River Plains, located at 998 E. Main Street, Strasburg, 
North Dakota, on June 7, 9, and 23, 2022. The 
inspection revealed evidence of significant violations of the Current Good 
Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food 
for Animals requirements located in Title 21, Code of Federal 
Regulations, Part 507 (21 CFR Part 507), which cause your 
products to be adulterated.1 The failure of the owner, operator, 
or agent in charge of a covered facility to comply 
with the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls provision of 
21 CFR Part 507 (located in subparts A, C, D, 
E, and F) is a prohibited act.2 In addition, the 
inspection revealed evidence of significant violations of the requirements for 
animal feed containing a Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) drug (VFD 
feed), located in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, section 
558.6 (21 CFR 558.6). Failure of a facility to comply 
with the VFD requirements causes the resulting VFD feed to 
be unsafe within the meaning of the FD&C Act.3 A 
drug is adulterated if it is an animal feed bearing 
or containing a new animal drug and the animal feed 
is unsafe.4 Furthermore, the failure of a facility to follow 
the VFD requirements causes the VFD feed to no longer 
be exempt from the requirement that its labeling bear adequate 
directions for use and as a result, the drug is 
misbranded if it does not bear adequate directions for use.5 
As described below, your labeling did not bear adequate directions 
for use. Lastly, the inspection revealed evidence of significant violations 
of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) for Medicated Feeds, 21 
CFR Part 225. Failure of a medicated feed mill to 
comply with these requirements causes a drug to be adulterated.6 
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of 
any food or drug that is adulterated or misbranded is 
a prohibited act.7 Additionally, the doing of any act to 
a food or drug after shipment of the food or 
drug and/or its components in interstate commerce and while the 
food or drug is held for sale (whether or not 
the first sale) that results in the food being adulterated 
or misbranded is a prohibited act.8 You may find the 
FD&C Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s 
website at www.fda.gov. At the close of the inspection you 
were issued a Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations (FDA-483). We acknowledge 
your written response received on July 5, 2022. We reviewed 
your response and address this response below, in relation to 
each of the noted violations. Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive 
Controls Requirements Your animal food facility is subject to the 
hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements found in 21 
CFR Part 507, subparts A, C, D, E, and F. 
During the inspection of your facility evidence of a significant 
violation of these requirements was noted. You did not conduct 
a hazard analysis to identify and evaluate, based on experience, 
illness data, scientific reports, and other information, known or reasonably 
foreseeable hazards for each type of animal food you manufacture, 
process, pack, or hold at your facility to determine whether 
there are any hazards requiring a preventive control, as required 
by 21 CFR 507.33(a). Specifically, you did not identify the 
known or reasonably foreseeable hazards of fumonisin and deoxynivalenol (DON 
or vomitoxin) for all grains and their co-products that you 
receive and use as ingredients at your facility, that are 
susceptible to fumonisin and vomitoxin, such as corn and oats. 
You also did not evaluate the severity of the illness 
or injury if these hazards were to occur, or the 
probability that they would occur in the absence of preventive 
controls, to determine whether they require a preventive control. Your 
response to the FDA-483 contained a signed food safety plan 
including a hazard analysis. The hazard analysis identifies mycotoxins at 
the “Bulk Ingredient” and “Bulk Ingredient Storage” steps as a 
hazard not requiring a preventive control. The justification for the 
decision states, “Management is responsible for determining the frequency of 
aflatoxin testing due to regional susceptibilities to aflatoxin contamination.” Your 
response is not adequate because your justification does not include 
an evaluation of fumonisin and DON. In addition, you did 
not provide the methodology used to determine the sample size, 
frequency, or parameters to identify “regional susceptibilities” for your aflatoxin 
testing, so we are unable to evaluate it. Furthermore, your 
response indicates that you will evaluate your raw material receiving 
procedures and develop testing and recording processes by July 10, 
2022. We encourage you to submit your new mycotoxin procedures 
so that we can assess them. Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) 
Requirements and Labeling Requirements As a VFD feed distributor, your 
facility is subject to the VFD requirements found in 21 
CFR 558.6. During the inspection of your facility it was 
noted that you distributed animal feed containing a VFD drug 
in a manner that did not comply with the terms 
of the VFD, as required by 21 CFR 558.6(c)(2). Specifically, 
on (b)(4), you distributed (b)(4) bags (50 lbs. each) of 
Aureomycin (chlortetracycline) 10g crumbles under VFD order (b)(4), dated (b)(4). 
However, your invoices demonstrate you subsequently refilled and distributed (b)(4) 
bags (50 lbs. each) of Aureomycin 10g crumbles on (b)(4), 
and (b)(4), under VFD order (b)(4). VFDs for chlortetracycline may 
not be refilled.9 Furthermore, the VFD states that “[r]eorders (refills) 
are not permitted with this VFD drug.” As noted above, 
your facility’s failure to follow the VFD requirements by not 
complying with the terms of the VFD causes your VFD 
feed to no longer be exempt from the requirement under 
section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act that its labeling bear 
adequate directions for use. You told the investigator that what 
is printed on invoices is the only labeling information that 
the customer receives from your firm. Your invoices do not 
include all of the elements required for drug labeling under 
21 CFR 201.5. For example, your invoices did not include 
indication, or frequency and duration of use. As a result, 
the Aureomycin drug you distributed is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) 
of the FD&C Act. Your response to the FDA 483 
states “feed personnel will be retrained on VFD and the 
local manager will verify the correct usage of all VFDs.” 
We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response 
as you did not provide documentation regarding whether training had 
occurred or details as to how the location manager verifies 
the correct usage of all VFDs. Medicated Feed Current Good 
Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Requirements Your facility is required to follow 
the medicated feed CGMP regulations for non-licensed, medicated animal feed 
manufacturers found in 21 CFR 225.120-202. During the inspection, the 
following significant violations were observed: 1. You failed to ensure 
that all deliveries of medicated feeds, whether bagged or in 
bulk, are adequately labeled to assure that the feed can 
be properly used, as required by 21 CFR 225.180.10 Specifically, 
your firm uses invoices as labeling that accompanies bulk feed 
that you manufacture and distribute to your customers. Six out 
of six invoices ((b)(4)) reviewed for medicated feeds containing monensin 
(Beef Balancer R1200) failed to include: feeding instructions, indications for 
use, and drug concentration. Additionally, 21 CFR 558.355(d)(6) requires all 
monensin-containing formulations to bear the caution statement, “Do not allow 
horses or other equines access to feed containing monensin. Ingestion 
of monensin by horses has been fatal.” Your labeling did 
not include this caution statement. Your response to the FDA-483 
states you adapted your process to include labels with deliveries 
and, if necessary, specific feeding instructions. We are unable to 
evaluate the adequacy of your response as you did not 
provide supporting documentation such as your new labeling process and 
examples of your new labeling. 2. You failed to ensure 
that a Type B medicated feed, containing monensin, was used 
in accordance with the drug’s labeled mixing directions, as required 
by 21 CFR 225.142. Specifically, on (b)(4), your facility manufactured 
and distributed an approximate (b)(4)-ton lot of medicated feed using 
1000 lbs. of Beef Balancer R1200, (a Type B medicated 
feed) with a concentration of 1,200g/ton of monensin. Labeled mixing 
instructions for the Beef Balancer R1200 state to mix 50 
lbs. to 1,950 lbs. of non-medicated ration for improved feed 
efficiency in feedlot cattle. Per these mixing 10 See also 
21 CFR 507.27(b). instructions, you should have added only approximately 
230 lbs. of Beef Balancer R1200 to this lot of 
medicated feed. Additionally, the lot you manufactured contained more than 
three times the amount of monensin approved for this use 
under 21 CFR 558.355(f)(3)(i). Your response states that a mixing 
error did not occur; rather, you failed to supply adequate 
feeding instructions to the producer. We are unable to evaluate 
your response, as you did not provide supporting documentation indicating 
this lot was intentionally manufactured superpotent for further mixing before 
feeding. Your response also did not provide any labeling for 
this product that would ensure the superpotent feed could be 
used properly. Conclusion This letter is not intended to be 
an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist at your 
facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible 
for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and 
for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. 
It is your responsibility to ensure that you comply with 
all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations. This letter 
notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity 
to address them. You should take prompt action to correct 
any violations. Failure to adequately address this matter may lead 
to legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. For 
more information about FDA’s current thinking on the requirements of 
21 CFR Part 507, see: Within 15 working days of 
receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing 
of the specific steps that you have taken to correct 
any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken 
to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies 
of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 
15 working days, state the reason for the delay and 
the time frame within which you will complete the correction. 
If you believe that you have complied with the FD&C 
Act and FDA regulations, include your reasoning and any supporting 
information for our consideration. Your written response should be sent 
to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 250 Marquette Avenue,

States United States Warning Letter #627211 December 2, 2022 


Dear 
Mr. Matthew Davidson: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
inspected your drug excipient manufacturing facility, DuPont Nutrition USA Inc., 
FEI 3013947845, at 1301 Ogletown Rd, Newark, Delaware, from November 
17 to December 15, 2021. This warning letter summarizes significant 
deviations from current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) for the manufacture 
of your excipient, Avicel, which is extensively used as a 
major component in a wide variety of drug products. Because 
your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or 
holding do not conform to CGMP, your excipient is adulterated 
within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). Additionally, 
your excipient is adulterated under section 501(b) of the FD&C 
Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(b), for failure to conform to compendial 
standards for strength, quality, or purity. We reviewed your January 
12, 2022, response to our Form FDA 483 in detail 
and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence. During our inspection, 
our investigators observed specific deviations including, but not limited to, 
the following. 1. Your firm failed to perform adequate investigation 
of complaints. Your firm manufactures microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) under the 
brand name Avicel, which is included in Drug Master File 
(DMF) 449 submitted to FDA. Avicel is used as a 
compression and flow aid in multiple drug product formulations. Between 
April 2020 and June 2021, you received approximately 50 complaints 
related to your Avicel excipient failing to meet the conductivity 
specifications. The conductivity quality standard for MCC is delineated in 
the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP). Failure to meet applicable USP standards 
also renders drugs adulterated under section 501(b) of the FD&C 
Act. You did not adequately evaluate these complaints. You only 
included retest and release data review in your initial investigation 
into conductivity complaints for Avicel. It was not until seven 
months later that you discovered your conductivity meter probe was 
encrusted with residue, thus giving inaccurate conductivity results. This conductivity 
meter was used for batch release testing and retesting as 
part of your complaint investigations. Your initial complaint investigation did 
not adequately evaluate whether your malfunctioning conductivity probe was potentially 
associated with these out of specification (OOS) conductivity complaints, especially 
when you determined that the complaints could not be verified. 
Notably, you later linked this fouled conductivity meter to OOS 
Avicel that you previously released and shipped to your customers. 
You did not communicate the OOS results to your customers 
in a timely manner. It took you more than three 
months after you opened your investigation to initiate communication with 
your customers. Appropriate action was not initiated against the affected 
batches until nine months after you became aware of the 
conductivity test failure. In your response you state, “product quality 
customer complaint data for the past 24 months were reviewed 
for trends that might indicate ineffective investigations or corrective and 
preventive actions,” and that “there were no significant trends observed.” 
This is contradictory to the customer complaint records FDA collected 
during the inspection. Additionally, you did not provide sufficient evidence 
of your review, including a protocol, the type of complaints 
reviewed, how many were related to compendial test results, and 
your evaluation report. You also did not provide details on 
how you incorporated the numerous Avicel conductivity complaints you received 
into your review. In response to this letter, provide a 
comprehensive, independent assessment of your overall system for investigating deviations, 
discrepancies, complaints, OOS results, and failures. Provide a detailed action 
plan to remediate this system. Your action plan should include, 
but not be limited to, significant improvements in investigation competencies, 
scope determination, root cause evaluation, corrective action and preventive action 
(CAPA) effectiveness, quality unit oversight, and written procedures. Address how 
your firm will ensure all phases of investigations are appropriately 
conducted. 2. You failed to thoroughly investigate OOS results in 
a timely manner, appropriately identify root causes, expand investigations to 
all potentially affected lots, and implement adequate CAPA. Your investigations 
into failing test results are inadequate. You had failing results 
for conductivity in Avicel lots. Your laboratory OOS results were 
only investigated by the original analyst using a checklist. The 
supervisory review did not include an evaluation of the records 
and test data. You failed to expand the investigation to 
production and other potentially affected lots. Your investigation also lacked 
sufficient evidence to determine the root cause and identify CAPAs. 
You did not perform a timely and thorough investigation into 
an inaccurate conductivity meter reading. Your investigation revealed a probe 
“encrusted with grime/resin” caused lower conductivity values. Although you identified 
OOS results in November 2020, you did not expand your 
investigation in a timely manner to determine the scope of 
potentially impacted lots tested using this meter. You determined the 
root cause of the conductivity OOS values was related to 
elevated levels of ammonium chloride in the Avicel. FDA is 
concerned as elevated levels of ammonium chloride in excipients has 
the potential to lead to impurity formation in finished drug 
products. Of note, such impurity formation could include nitrosamines. For 
FDA’s current thinking on this topic, see FDA’s guidance, Control 
of Nitrosamine Impurities in Human Drugs at https://www.fda.gov/media/141720/download. In your 
response you state you conducted a review of laboratory OOS 
investigations for the past year; however, you did not provide 
a rationale to support this limited time period versus the 
standard expiration period of your drugs. In addition, you did 
not expand this review to manufacturing investigations. Your response also 
lacks a commitment or details on how to address released 
excipient associated with process deviations or OOS investigations. In response 
to this letter, provide: o Determine whether the scientific justification 
and evidence relating to the invalidated OOS result conclusively or 
inconclusively demonstrates causative laboratory error. o For investigations that conclusively 
establish laboratory root cause, provide the rationale, and ensure that 
all other laboratory methods vulnerable to the same or similar 
root cause are identified for remediation. o For all OOS 
results found by the retrospective review to have an inconclusive 
or no root cause identified in the laboratory, include a 
thorough review of production (e.g., batch manufacturing records, adequacy of 
the manufacturing steps, suitability of equipment/facilities, variability of raw materials, 
process capability, deviation history, complaint history, batch failure history). Provide 
a summary of potential manufacturing root causes for each investigation, 
and any manufacturing operation improvements. o Quality unit oversight of 
laboratory investigations o Identification of adverse laboratory control trends o 
Resolution of causes of laboratory variation o Initiation of thorough 
investigations of potential manufacturing causes whenever a laboratory cause cannot 
be conclusively identified o Adequately scoping of each investigation and 
its CAPA o Revised OOS investigation procedures with these and 
other remediations 3. Your firm failed to ensure the test 
methods used are suitable for their intended use. You are 
currently using compendial and non-compendial conductivity test methods for in-process 
and release testing of your Avicel lots. Your firm failed 
to adequately verify and validate your compendial and non-compendial conductivity 
methods, respectively. You were unable to provide evidence of method 
verification and validation prior to April 2021 even though you 
used these test methods to conduct release testing for Avicel 
prior April 2021. A. You failed to verify the compendial 
conductivity test method and evaluate if additional verification parameters or 
validation were required due to changes in sample preparation. For 
example: o You failed to have an approved method verification 
protocol with pre-established requirements for your most current (April 13, 
2021) test method report. You were also unable to locate 
the testing instructions for your precision study. o Your compendial 
method verification failed to evaluate accuracy of the test method. 
o You lacked scientific rationale to support the range evaluated 
during the method verification ((b)(4) of the specification limit). o 
You lacked adequate scientific justification to identify an anomalous result 
obtained during your precision study as an “outlier” and to 
exclude it from the study. o Review of your raw 
data compared to your report indicated discrepancies in the number 
of samples and the timing of testing. B. You failed 
to validate your non-compendial method for in-process and packaging testing. 
You attempted to correlate your compendial and non-compendial test methods 
as part of your validation of your “quick methods.” Your 
results showed a low correlation and a significant difference between 
the methods. Of concern, the data showed significantly lower conductivity 
values when compared to the compendial method. However, you concluded 
that the methods had good correlation and authorized it for 
use in production in place of the compendial method. This 
may have resulted in inaccurately low conductivity results being used 
to release Avicel that in fact failed USP conductivity requirements. 
C. You inappropriately used composite sampling. While you utilized your 
non-compendial “(b)(4)” for individual packaged samples, the certificate of analysis 
included the result of the composite sample. A review of 
the data indicated passing composite sample results comprised of samples 
which included individual failing packaging samples. The use of composite 
sampling may have allowed the release of OOS Avicel to 
the market. Additionally, your practice of composite sampling is concerning 
considering your non-compendial “(b)(4)” provided inaccurate results and you were 
using composite samples inappropriately for release testing. You lacked an 
adequate scientific rationale for the use of compendial test methods 
for composite samples and non-compendial test methods for in-process and 
packaged samples. Your response is inadequate. You reiterate that you 
verified your compendial method but failed to provide adequate information 
to support this. We acknowledge your commitment to validate your 
non-compendial test methods, including conductivity and pH. In response to 
this letter, provide: 4. Your firm failed to have an 
adequate change management program to evaluate and approve changes that 
may impact the quality of the excipient. Your Avicel process 
performance qualification studies conducted from 2001 through 2007 identified conductivity 
as a critical quality parameter. However, in approximately 2011 you 
removed the (b)(4) conductivity meters without a documented change control. 
In your response you state that at the time of 
the change you evaluated the potential impact on the quality 
of Avicel but did not document this evaluation. You also 
state you will evaluate the impact of any other process 
changes implemented without adequate review on the quality of your 
excipient. You commit to evaluate process changes for potential impact 
on other critical quality parameters listed in your most current 
validations (dated 2001, 2004, and 2007). However, you did not 
provide a detailed plan or timeline for implementation of your 
revised change management program. In response to this letter, provide: 
5. Your firm failed to have adequate laboratory control records 
that include complete and accurate data from tests performed to 
ensure conformance with specifications and standards, nor did you record 
activities at the time of performance. During the inspection, your 
laboratory personnel backdated the approval section of an in-house microbiological 
media preparation worksheet after the media had been used. In 
addition, your microbiology laboratory personnel were observed using unreleased microbiological 
growth media plates during drug testing. Your personnel improperly retested 
pH, conductivity, loss on drying, and particle size samples. We 
observed failing results changed to passing based on retest results. 
You were unable to provide adequate investigations or justification associated 
with the retests. Your sample testing records are incomplete because 
they do not include information about sample weight, and a 
reference to reagents and instruments used. Without complete, timely, and 
accurate testing records, you cannot adequately evaluate the quality of 
your excipient, make appropriate batch release decisions, or fully understand 
the potential impact of poor manufacturing practices on the quality 
of your excipient. Your response is inadequate. For example: In 
response to this letter, provide: Data Integrity Remediation Your quality 
system does not adequately ensure the accuracy and integrity of 
data to support the safety, effectiveness, and quality of the 
excipient you manufacture. You may find principles outlined in the 
FDA’s data integrity guidance helpful as you consider remediating this 
issue, see Data Integrity and Compliance With Drug CGMP at 
https://www.fda.gov/media/119267/download. We strongly recommend that you hire a qualified third-party 
auditor/consultant with experience in detecting data integrity problems to assist 
you with coming into compliance with CGMP requirements. In response 
to this letter, provide the following: Test Results Out-of-Specification You 
may find principles outlined in the FDA’s OOS guidance helpful 
as you consider remediating this issue, see Investigating Out-of-Specification (OOS) 
Test Results for Pharmaceutical Production at https://www.fda.gov/media/71001/download. A possible laboratory 
error is insufficient to close an investigation. Whenever an investigation 
lacks conclusive evidence of laboratory error, a thorough investigation of 
potential manufacturing causes should be performed. CGMP Consultant Recommended Based 
upon the nature of the deviations we identified at your 
firm, we strongly recommend engaging a consultant qualified to evaluate 
your operations and to assist your firm in meeting excipient 
CGMP requirements. We also recommend that the qualified consultant perform 
a comprehensive audit of your entire operation for CGMP compliance 
and that the consultant evaluate the completion and efficacy of 
your corrective actions and preventive actions before you pursue resolution 
of your firm’s compliance status with FDA. Your use of 
a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply 
with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving 
all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance. 
Conclusion The deviations cited in this letter are not intended 
to be an all-inclusive list of deviations that exist at 
your facility. You are responsible for investigating and determining the 
causes of any deviations and for preventing their recurrence or 
the occurrence of other deviations. If you are considering an 
action that is likely to lead to a disruption in 
the supply of drug produced at your facility, FDA requests 
that you contact CDER’s Drug Shortages Staff immediately, at drugshortages@fda.hhs.gov, 
so that FDA can work with you on the most 
effective way to bring your operations into compliance with the 
law. Contacting the Drug Shortages Staff also allows you to 
meet any obligations you may have to report discontinuances or 
interruptions in your drug manufacture under 21 U.S.C. 356C(b). This 
also allows FDA to consider, as soon as possible, what 
actions, if any, may be needed to avoid shortages and 
protect the health of patients who depend on your products. 
Correct any deviations promptly. Failure to promptly and adequately address 
this matter may result in legal action without further notice 
including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. Unresolved deviations may also 
prevent other Federal agencies from awarding contracts. We may re-inspect 
to verify that you have completed corrective actions to address 
any deviations. This letter notifies you of our findings and 
provides you an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. After 
you receive this letter, respond to this office in writing 
within 15 working days. Specify what you have done to 
address any deviations and to prevent their recurrence. In response 
to this letter, you may provide additional information for our 
consideration as we continue to assess your activities and practices. 
If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, 
state your reasons for delay and your schedule for completion. 
Please send your electronic reply to Compliance Officer Yvette Johnson

States United States WARNING LETTER Re: CMS # 642784 


Dear 
Mr. Jorge Avila: On July 7 through August 17, 2022, 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a Foreign Supplier 
Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of Del Valle Import Corp., located 
at 1231 Lafayette Avenue Bronx, NY 10474. We also conducted 
an inspection July 7 through August 23, 2021. These inspections 
were conducted to determine compliance with the requirements of section 
805 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C 
Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 
21 CFR part 1, subpart L. The FSVP regulation requires 
that importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human 
and/or animal food they import into the United States has 
been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food 
safety standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP 
regulation and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through 
links in FDA’s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals. During the 
most recent inspection, we found that you are not in 
compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart 
L for the foods you import. Because of these significant 
violations, you are not in compliance with section 805 of 
the FD&C Act. At the conclusion of the inspection, our 
investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483a, FSVP Observations. 
We have not received your response to the Form FDA 
483a issued on August 17, 2022. Your significant violations of 
the FSVP regulation are as follows: You did not develop, 
maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by section 805 
of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 1.502(a). Specifically, you 
did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP for any 
of the foods you import, including the following foods: You 
import fresh produce that is “covered produce” as defined in 
21 CFR 112.3. As an importer of covered produce, you 
must have an FSVP that demonstrates that your supplier is 
producing the food in compliance with processes and procedures that 
provide at least the same level of public health protection 
as those required under section 419 of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. 350h) (regarding standards for produce safety) and the 
implementing regulations in the Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, 
and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption (21 CFR part 
112). The above violations are not intended to be an 
all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. It is 
your responsibility to ensure that you are in compliance with 
section 805 of the FD&C Act and the implementing regulation 
in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L. This letter notifies 
you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to 
address them. If you do not adequately address this matter, 
we may take further action. For instance, we may take 
action under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the food you import for 
which you appear to be in violation of section 805. 
We may place the foods you import into the United 
States on detention without physical examination (DWPE) when you import 
the foods. You can find DWPE information relating to FSVP 
in Import Alert #99-41 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation 
or offering for importation into the United States of an 
article of food without the importer having an FSVP that 
meets the requirements of section 805 of the FD&C Act 
or the FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(zz)). You should respond in 
writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of 
this letter. Your response should address the specific things you 
are doing to correct any violations. You should include in

28206-4206 United States United States 


Dear Ms. Ankitha Yalamanchili: On 
April 14, through April 21, 2022, the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) 
inspection of Sree Nidhi Corp, located at 3301 Woodpark Blvd 
Ste D Charlotte, NC 28206. We also conducted an initial 
inspection on March 3, 2021. These inspections were conducted to 
determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 of the 
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 
384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 CFR part 
1 subpart L. The FSVP regulation requires that importers perform 
certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or animal food 
they import into the United States has been produced in 
a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety standards. You 
may find information relating to the FSVP regulation and your 
responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links in FDA’s 
FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals. During the most recent inspection, 
we found that you are not in compliance with the 
requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart L for the 
foods you import. Because of these significant violations, you are 
not in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act. 
At the conclusion of both inspections, our investigator provided you 
with a Form FDA 483a, FSVP Observations. We have not 
received your response to the Form FDA 483a. This is 
a repeated observation for which no corrective action plan has 
been offered to overcome the citation of your most recent 
483a issued on April 21, 2022. Your significant violations of 
the FSVP regulation are as follows: You did not develop, 
maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by section 805 
of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 1.502(a). Specifically, you 
did not develop an FSVP for any of the food 
products that you import, including: • Karivepaku with Garlic Spices 
imported from (b)(4) located in (b)(4). • Semolina Course Wheat 
imported from (b)(4) located in (b)(4). • Maize Atta Corn 
Flour imported from (b)(4) located in (b)(4). • Frozen Mango 
Slices imported from (b)(4) located in (b)(4). The above violations 
are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations 
of the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure 
that you are in compliance with section 805 of the 
FD&C Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 
1, subpart L. This letter notifies you of our concerns 
and provides you with the opportunity to promptly correct the 
above violations. If you do not adequately correct them, we 
may take further action. For instance, we may take action 
under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) 
to refuse admission of the food you import for which 
you appear to be in violation of section 805. We 
may place the foods you import into the United States 
on detention without physical examination (DWPE) when you import the 
foods. You can find DWPE information relating to FSVP in 
Import Alert #99-41 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or 
offering for importation into the United States of an article 
of food without the importer having an FSVP that meets 
the requirements of section 805 of the FD&C Act or 
the FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(zz)). You should respond in writing 
within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this 
letter. Your response should address the specific things you are 
doing to correct these violations. You should include in your 
response documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating 
your corrections, (e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as 
a copy of your FSVP, records to demonstrate implementation of 
your FSVP, and any additional information that you wish to 
supply relevant to your compliance with the FSVP regulation). If 
you believe that your products are not in violation of 
the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information 
for our consideration. If you cannot complete all corrections within 
fifteen (15) working days, you should explain the reason for 
your delay and state when you will correct any remaining 
violations. Please send your reply to Food and Drug Administration,

Palma, CA 90623 United States United States WARNING LETTER FDA 
Ref. No.: 22-HFD-45-12-01 


Dear Dr. Daswani: This Warning Letter informs 
you of objectionable conditions observed during the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) inspection conducted at your clinical site between 
October 18 and October 29, 2021. Investigators Dustin R. Abaonza 
and Yuanyuan Li, representing FDA, reviewed your conduct of a 
clinical investigation [Protocol (b)(4), “(b)(4)”] of the investigational drug (b)(4), 
performed for (b)(4). This inspection was conducted as a part 
of FDA’s Bioresearch Monitoring Program, which includes inspections designed to 
evaluate the conduct of research and to help ensure that 
the rights, safety, and welfare of human subjects have been 
protected. At the conclusion of the inspection, Investigators Abaonza and 
Li presented and discussed with you the Form FDA 483, 
Inspectional Observations. We acknowledge receipt of your November 18, 2021, 
written response to the Form FDA 483. From our review 
of the FDA Establishment Inspection Report, the documents submitted with 
that report, and your written response dated November 18, 2021, 
it appears that you did not adhere to the applicable 
statutory requirements in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(FD&C Act) and applicable regulations contained in Title 21 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations, part 312 [21 CFR 312] 
governing the conduct of clinical investigations and the protection of 
human subjects. We wish to emphasize the following: You failed 
to ensure that the investigation was conducted according to the 
investigational plan [21 CFR 312.60]. As a clinical investigator, you 
are required to ensure that your clinical studies are conducted 
in accordance with the investigational plan. The investigational plan for 
Protocol (b)(4) required you to ensure that randomized treatment was 
administered, randomized treatment dose adjustments were made by the Interactive 
Response Technology (IRT) system, and protocol-specified procedures were followed when 
hemoglobin concentration (Hgb) measured by HemoCue was ≥12 g/dL. You 
failed to adhere to these requirements. Examples of this failure 
include, but are not limited to, the following: a. From 
Study Day 1 until end of treatment, the protocol required 
subjects randomized (b)(4). You failed to adhere to these requirements. 
Specifically, (b)(4) doses were not administered to the following subjects 
randomized to receive (b)(4) and on (b)(4): i. For Subject 
(b)(6), thirty-four (b)(4) doses were not administered, including fourteen consecutive 
doses. ii. For Subject (b)(6), forty-three (b)(4) doses were not 
administered, including twelve consecutive doses from (b)(6). On (b)(6), this 
subject had severe (b)(4) and was hospitalized to receive 1 
unit of packed red blood cells. iii. For Subject (b)(6), 
fifteen (b)(4) doses were not administered. b. The protocol required 
randomized treatment dose adjustments to be made programmatically by the 
IRT system, based on the HemoCue Hgb value measured at 
least every 12 weeks from Week 52 through end of 
treatment. You failed to adhere to this requirement. Specifically, IRT 
transactions were not conducted to obtain the randomized treatment dose 
for the following subjects: i. Subject (b)(6) did not have 
IRT transactions performed at Week 76 ((b)(6)), Week 88 ((b)(6)), 
or Week 124 ((b)(6)). Of note, Week 76 and Week 
88 were consecutive protocol-required study visits. ii. Subject (b)(6) did 
not have IRT transactions performed at Week 88 ((b)(6)), Week 
100 ((b)(6)), Week 112 ((b)(6)), or Week 124 ((b)(6)). Of 
note, Week 88, Week 100, Week 112, and Week 124 
were consecutive protocol-required study visits. iii. Subject (b)(6) did not 
have IRT transactions performed at Week 64 ((b)(6)). c. The 
protocol required that, if HemoCue Hgb was ≥12 g/dL at 
a study visit, HemoCue Hgb was to be repeated at 
the same study visit and the values were to be 
averaged. If HemoCue Hgb was repeated and confirmed to be 
≥12 g/dL, randomized treatment dose was to be temporarily held. 
HemoCue Hgb was to be checked at a study visit 
4 weeks later. If HemoCue Hgb was <11.5 g/dL, provided 
it had been at least 2 weeks since the previous 
study visit, randomized treatment was to be restarted at one 
dose step lower. You failed to adhere to these requirements. 
Specifically, Subject (b)(6), randomized to (b)(4), had a HemoCue Hgb 
of 12.6 g/dL, which was repeated and confirmed to be 
≥12 g/dL (12.6 g/dL) on (b)(6). However, randomized treatment dose 
was not held, and (b)(4) was administered on (b)(6). Subsequently, 
on (b)(6), HemoCue Hgb was 12.7 g/dL, which was repeated 
and confirmed to be ≥12 g/dL (12.7 g/dL), and (b)(4) 
was held. However, on (b)(6), (b)(4) was administered, rather than 
reducing or holding the (b)(4) dose as required by the 
protocol. On (b)(6), HemoCue Hgb was <11.5 g/dL (10.9 g/dL). 
However, (b)(4) was not administered as required by the protocol, 
even though it had been at least 2 weeks since 
the previous study visit. Subsequently, on (b)(6), (b)(4) was administered 
without reducing the dose of (b)(4) by one dose step. 
You stated during the inspection that nurses would periodically tell 
you, “We are supposed to have a dose and don’t 
have a dose,” and you would then text the study 
coordinator. You also stated that you first became aware that 
the study coordinators were ordering replacement kits to resupply the 
inventory rather than using the IRT system to generate randomized 
treatment doses, when the monitor emailed you in January 2020, 
which we note is over a year after multiple subjects 
missed multiple doses, as described above. In your November 18, 
2021, written response to the violations listed above, you confirmed 
what you had stated during the inspection. You reiterated that, 
among other things, your lack of awareness of study staff’s 
not performing IRT transactions as required by the protocol, leading 
to missed and incorrect doses of randomized treatment for an 
extended period of time, suggests inadequate oversight. You also stated 
that your lack of awareness that a particular individual was 
performing the task of study coordinator suggests inadequate oversight. We 
emphasize that your failure to conduct the clinical study in 
accordance with the protocol raises significant concerns about your protection 
of the study subjects enrolled at your site, and also 
raises concerns about the validity and integrity of the data 
collected at your site. Specifically, your failure to administer doses, 
make protocol-required dose adjustments, and perform IRT transactions to appropriately 
generate randomized treatment doses as required by the protocol, jeopardizes 
subject safety and welfare and raises significant concerns about the 
validity and integrity of the data collected at your site. 
As the clinical investigator, you are responsible for ensuring compliance 
with the protocol-required IRT transaction and dosing requirements. In addition, 
you stated in your written response the corrective and preventive 
actions you have taken or plan to take, including the 
development of a new oversight standard operating procedure (SOP) to 
improve protocol compliance and communication and awareness of issues between 
you and your study staff, and to ensure that all 
staff involved in conducting and managing a research study are 
qualified and trained to undertake their delegated duties. You also 
stated that you are retaking a good clinical practice course 
and a course on oversight and responsibilities in clinical research; 
that you are requiring the site management organization to notify 
you whenever a study coordinator is departing or being assigned 
to the study; and that you are assigning a backup 
study coordinator to each of your studies. While we acknowledge 
the actions that you and your site have taken or 
plan to take, we request that you specify the corrective 
actions that you, as a clinical investigator, have taken or 
plan to take to prevent similar violations in the future. 
For example, the SOP does not include sufficient details about 
the policies being instituted to ensure compliance with the protocol, 
particularly with respect to ensuring that similar violations having to 
do with IRT transactions and treatment requirements are prevented. Without 
these details, we are unable to determine whether your corrective 
actions appear adequate to help prevent similar violations in the 
future. We emphasize that as the clinical investigator, you were 
ultimately responsible to ensure that your clinical study was conducted 
properly and in compliance with FDA regulations, both to protect 
the rights, safety, and welfare of study subjects and to 
ensure the integrity of study data. Your failure to perform 
the above-mentioned study procedures as required by the protocol, and 
your lack of oversight and supervision of the clinical study, 
raise significant concerns about the safety of study subjects enrolled 
at your site and the integrity of the data generated 
at your site. This letter is not intended to be 
an all-inclusive list of deficiencies with your clinical study of 
an investigational drug. It is your responsibility to ensure adherence 
to each requirement of the law and relevant FDA regulations. 
You should address any deficiencies and establish procedures to ensure 
that any ongoing or future studies comply with FDA regulations. 
This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you 
an opportunity to address the deficiencies specified above. Within 15 
business days of your receipt of this letter, you should 
notify this office in writing of the actions you have 
taken to prevent similar violations in the future. Failure to 
adequately address this matter may lead to regulatory action. If 
you believe that you have complied with the FD&C Act 
and relevant regulations, please include your reasoning and any supporting 
information for our consideration. If you have any questions, please 
call Miah Jung, Pharm.D., M.S., at 240-402-3728 or e-mail her

IL 60195 United States United States 


Dear Dr. Kaemmerer: You 
registered your facility with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) as an outsourcing facility under section 503B of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) [21 U.S.C. § 
353b]1 on May 29, 2015, and reregistered most recently on 
November 29, 2021. From September 21, 2021 to November 4, 
2021, FDA investigators inspected your facility that was acquired by 
Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SterRx, LLC, located at 141 Idaho Avenue, 
Plattsburgh, NY 12903. During the inspection, the investigators noted serious 
deficiencies in your practices for producing drug products intended or 
expected to be sterile, which put patients at risk. FDA 
issued a Form FDA 483 to your facility on November 
4, 2021, and an amended Form FDA 483 on December 
1, 2021. FDA acknowledges receipt of your facility’s responses, including 
correspondence dated November 23, 2021, January 31, 2022, March 31, 
2022, and June 30, 2022. FDA also acknowledges that your 
firm voluntarily ceased “production and distribution of all aseptically processed 
products” as of October 5, 2021. In addition, we acknowledge 
that on November 12, 2021, your firm initiated a voluntary 
recall of approximately (b)(4) lots of certain drug products intended 
to be sterile that were within expiry due to a 
lack of sterility assurance. Furthermore, FDA acknowledges your firm’s February 
4, 2022 ""45-day Notification of Intent to Resume Distribution"" of 
sterile products on or after (b)(4) and your firm’s commitment 
to destroy (b)(4) in-process lots pursuant to a teleconference held 
on March 21, 2022. Based on this inspection, it appears 
you produced drugs that violate the FDCA. A. Compounded Drug 
Products under the FDCA Under section 503B(b) of the FDCA, 
a compounder can register as an outsourcing facility with FDA. 
Drug products compounded by or under the direct supervision of 
a licensed pharmacist in an outsourcing facility qualify for exemptions 
from the drug approval requirements in section 505 of the 
FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 355(a)], the requirement in section 502(f)(1) 
of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] that labeling bear 
adequate directions for use and the Drug Supply Chain Security 
Act requirements in section 582 of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. 
§ 360eee-1] if the conditions in section 503B of the 
FDCA are met.2 An outsourcing facility, which is defined in 
section 503B(d)(4) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 353b(d)(4)], is 
a facility at one geographic location or address that — 
(i) is engaged in the compounding of sterile drugs; (ii) 
has elected to register as an outsourcing facility; and (iii) 
complies with all of the requirements of this section. Outsourcing 
facilities must comply with other applicable provisions of the FDCA, 
including section 501(a)(2)(B) [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B)], regarding current good 
manufacturing practice (CGMP), and section 501(a)(2)(A) [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(A)], 
regarding insanitary conditions. Generally, CGMP requirements for the preparation of 
drug products are established in Title 21 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations (CFR) parts 210 and 211. C. Violations 
of the FDCA Adulterated Drug Products FDA investigators noted that 
drug products intended or expected to be sterile were prepared, 
packed, or held under insanitary conditions, whereby they may have 
become contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health, causing 
your drug products to be adulterated under section 501(a)(2)(A) of 
the FDCA. For example, the investigators observed that: 1. Your 
facility is designed and operated in a way that first 
air is either not provided or blocked within ISO 5 
areas where critical in-process operations are performed. For example: a. 
Lack of first pass air over unwrapped, open IV bags 
prior to filling. b. Blocked first pass air for exposed 
sterile closures (ports and syringe plungers) during introduction and conveyance 
on IV bag filling lines. 2. Your smoke studies demonstrated 
that the air in an ISO 5 classified zone was 
turbulent and non-laminar near areas where IV bag filling and 
sealing are performed. 3. You did not perform adequate product 
evaluation and take appropriate corrective action after microbial contamination was 
recovered within the ISO 5 aseptic processing area. 4. Your 
firm does not maintain the sterility of inter seals and 
outer closures for IV bags during production. (b)(4) IV bags 
and caps with ports are exposed to worse than ISO 
5 quality air prior to and during assembly/capping. 5. The 
ISO-classified areas had visibly dirty equipment and difficult to clean 
surfaces. Specifically, chipped and missing paint, apparent rust, adhesive tape, 
and a build-up of residues were observed on and around 
(b)(4) equipment in an area where parisons are cut and 
conveyed to the point of aseptic filling. 6. Sterilized equipment 
and utensils wrapped (b)(4) and (b)(4) were stored in your 
“transition area,” an unclassified area, without an established hold time 
to ensure that these items remain sterile. FDA investigators also 
noted CGMP violations at your facility, that caused your drug 
product(s) to be adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) 
of the FDCA. The violations include, for example: 1. Your 
firm failed to establish an adequate air supply (b)(4) particulate 
air filters under positive pressure in the aseptic processing areas 
(21 CFR 211.42(c)(10)(iii)). 2. Your firm failed to establish an 
adequate system for monitoring environmental conditions in aseptic processing areas 
(21 CFR 211.42(c)(10)(iv)). 3. Your firm failed to ensure container 
closure systems provide protection against foreseeable external factors in storage 
and use that can cause deterioration or contamination of the 
drug product (21 CFR 211.94(b)). 4. Your firm failed to 
use equipment in the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of 
drug products that is of appropriate design, adequate size, and 
suitably located to facilitate operations for its intended use and 
for its cleaning and maintenance (21 CFR 211.63). 5. Your 
firm failed to ensure that substances required for equipment operations, 
such as lubricants and coolants, do not come in contact 
with components, drug product containers, closures, in-process materials, or drug 
products so as to alter the safety, identity, strength, quality 
or purity of the drug product beyond the official or 
other established requirements (211.65(b)). 6. Your firm failed to thoroughly 
investigate any unexplained discrepancy or failure of a batch or 
any of its components to meet any of its specifications, 
whether or not the batch has already been distributed (21 
CFR 211.192). 7. Your firm failed to clean, maintain, and, 
as appropriate for the nature of the drug, sanitize and/or 
sterilize equipment and utensils at appropriate intervals to prevent malfunctions 
or contamination that would alter the safety, identity, strength, quality, 
or purity of the drug product beyond the official or 
other established requirements (21 CFR 211.67(a)). 8. Your firm failed 
to establish and follow appropriate written procedures that are designed 
to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be 
sterile, and that include validation of all aseptic and sterilization 
processes (21 CFR 211.113(b)). Outsourcing facilities must comply with CGMP 
requirements under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FDCA. FDA’s regulations regarding 
CGMP requirements for the preparation of drug products have been 
established in 21 CFR parts 210 and 211. FDA intends 
to promulgate more specific CGMP regulations for outsourcing facilities. FDA 
has issued a revised draft guidance, Current Good Manufacturing Practice 
— Guidance for Human Drug Compounding Outsourcing Facilities under Section 
503B of the FD&C Act. This draft guidance, when finalized, 
will describe FDA’s expectations regarding outsourcing facilities and the CGMP 
requirements in 21 CFR parts 210 and 211 until more 
specific CGMP regulations for outsourcing facilities are promulgated. Under section 
301(a) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)], the introduction 
or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any drug 
that is adulterated is a prohibited act. Further, it is 
a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FDCA [21 
U.S.C. § 331(k)] to do any act with respect to 
a drug, if such act is done while the drug 
is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and 
results in the drug being adulterated. D. Corrective Actions We 
have reviewed your facility’s responses to the Form FDA 483. 
FDA acknowledges that your firm voluntarily ceased “production and distribution 
of all aseptically processed products” as of October 5, 2021, 
and that your firm intended to resume distribution of sterile 
products on or after (b)(4). We also acknowledge that on 
November 12, 2021, your firm initiated a voluntary recall of 
certain lots of drug products intended to be sterile that 
were within expiry due to a lack of sterility assurance. 
In addition, we acknowledge that your firm voluntarily destroyed (b)(4) 
in-process lots in March 2022 and (b)(4) in-process lot on 
May 2, 2022. Furthermore, FDA acknowledges your “intent to continue 
[the voluntary destruction] process with the remaining (b)(4) lots within 
inventory…” We are unable to fully evaluate some of your 
corrective actions due to lack of adequate supporting documentation. For 
example: 1. In response to Observation 1 of the Form 
FDA 483, you stated in part: new smoke studies will 
be performed; environmental monitoring for particles will be revised; (b)(4) 
machinery and surrounding barriers will be assessed; integrity testing (leak 
check test) will be performed, equipment that remains in use 
will be relocated to ensure first pass air is not 
blocked; and employee training will be provided to include operator 
prevention of obstructing first pass air. However, you did not 
provide: a. CMTs 2021-424, 2021-426, 2021-427, 2021-428, 2021-429, 2021-430, and 
2021-431 referenced in your response pertaining to (b)(4) smoke studies, 
changes to particle monitoring, equipment and barrier assessment, leak check 
testing, and operator training. b. Change controls 2021-109 and 2021-110 
referenced in your response pertaining to decommissioning of filling lines, 
installation of (b)(4) particle monitoring equipment, and environmental monitoring revisions. 
2. In response to Observation 2 of the Form FDA 
483, you provided a written risk assessment for capping of 
(b)(4) IV bags and a study evaluating the sterility of 
caps. However, you did not provide any supporting documentation, such 
as air certification reports, to demonstrate that the caps and 
bags are not exposed to worse than ISO 5 quality 
air during loading, conveying, and capping. 3. In response to 
Observation 3 of the Form FDA 483, you stated in 
part: limits for the ISO 5 zones will be changed 
to (b)(4); environmental monitoring limits will be standardized (b)(4); and 
the entire environmental monitoring program will be evaluated. Additionally, your 
response stated (b)(4) and (b)(4). However, you did not provide: 
a. CMTs 2021-435 and 2021-436 referenced in your response pertaining 
to your environmental monitoring evaluation, revised procedures for ISO 5 
zones, and changes to particle monitoring. b. Completed document change 
controls DCC-002749 and DCC-003733 referenced in your response pertaining to 
revised viable action limits. 4. In response to Observation 4 
of the Form FDA 483, you stated in part: the 
bag filling line would be decommissioned and a new corporate 
policy, PQL-QA-0025 will be implemented to ensure equipment is adequate 
for GMP processes. However, you did not provide a copy 
of PQL-QA-0025 or CMT 2021-444 referenced in your response for 
policy implementation and employee training. 5. In response to Observation 
5 of the Form FDA 483, you stated in part: 
the bag filling line would be decommissioned; an assessment would 
be performed for all product contact lubricants; and SOP-VAL-0103, Equipment/Utility 
and Software Validation/Qualification, would be revised to include (b)(4). However, 
you did not provide a copy of the revised SOP-VAL-0103 
or CMTs 2021-438 and 2021-439 referenced in your response for 
SOP revisions and employee training. 6. In response to Observation 
6 of the Form FDA 483, you stated in part: 
the site will transition to compliance software for non-conformances and 
CAPAs; enhanced training for aseptic techniques and investigations will be 
developed; and SOP-QA-0157, Manufacturing Investigation Procedure, will be revised. However, 
you did not provide: a. CMT 2021-414 referenced in your 
response pertaining to your changes to investigations, CAPAs, and related 
training. b. A copy of SOP-QA-0157. 7. In response to 
Observation 7 of the Form FDA 483, you stated in 
part: SOP-VAL-0103, Equipment/Utility and Software Validation/Qualification, will be revised and 
employee training will be conducted. However, you did not provide 
a copy of SOP-VAL-0103 or CMT 2021-439 referenced in your 
response for SOP revisions and employee training. 8. In response 
to Observation 8 of the Form FDA 483, you stated 
in part: revisions will be made to SOP-P-0435, Operation and 
Maintenance of the (b)(4). However, you did not provide a 
copy of SOP-P-0435 or CMT 2021-411 referenced in your response. 
Additionally, you did not provide supporting documentation referenced in the 
attachment identified as (b)(4) including but not limited to third-party 
studies for the lethality of the (b)(4). In addition to 
the issues discussed above, you should note that CGMP requires 
the implementation of quality oversight and controls over the manufacture 
of drugs, including the safety of raw materials, materials used 
in drug manufacturing, and finished drug products. See section 501 
of the FDCA. If you choose to contract with a 
laboratory to perform some functions required by CGMP, it is 
essential that you select a qualified contractor and that you 
maintain sufficient oversight of the contractor’s operations to ensure that 
it is fully CGMP compliant. Regardless of whether you rely 
on a contract facility, you are responsible for assuring that 
drugs you produce are neither adulterated nor misbranded. [See 21 
CFR 210.1(b), 21 CFR 200.10(b).] FDA strongly recommends that your 
management undertake a comprehensive assessment of operations, including facility design, 
procedures, personnel, processes, maintenance, materials, and systems. In particular, this 
review should assess your aseptic processing operations. We also recommend 
a third-party consultant with relevant sterile drug manufacturing expertise to 
assist you in conducting this comprehensive evaluation. E. Conclusion The 
violations cited in this letter are not intended to be 
an all-inclusive statement of violations at your facility. You are 
responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations 
and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other 
violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm 
complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations. 
You should take prompt action to address any violations. Failure 
to adequately address any violations may result in legal action 
without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. Within 
fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please 
notify this office in writing of the specific steps you 
have taken to address any violations, or you may inform 
us that you do not intend to resume production of 
drugs intended or expected to be sterile. This letter notifies 
you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to 
address them. If you believe your products are not in 
violation of the FDCA, include your reasoning and any supporting 
information for our consideration. If you cannot completely address this 
matter within fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for 
the delay and the time within which you will do 
so. Send your electronic reply to ORAPHARM1_RESPONSES@fda.hhs.gov. Your written notification 
should refer to Warning Letter #636636 and include FEI: 3010840309.

19401 United States United States December 22, 2022WARNING LETTER 


Dear 
Mr. Poole: The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions to 
the FDA and our inspection records, and determined that JP 
& SN Enterprises Inc. d/b/a eCigs International manufactures and distributes 
e-liquid products for commercial distribution in the United States, and 
that the e-liquid products are manufactured and offered for sale 
or distribution to customers in the United States. Under section 
201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C 
Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products 
because they are made or derived from tobacco or contain 
nicotine from any source, and intended for human consumption. Certain 
tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction 
under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1, and are required to 
be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act. 
Please be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President 
signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA’s 
jurisdiction to products “containing nicotine from any source,” not just 
nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public 
Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this 
legislation expanded the definition of “tobacco product” under section 201(rr) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include 
products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including e-liquid 
products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance 
with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more 
information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14. Generally, to be legally marketed in 
the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” 
to have a premarket authorization in effect. A “new tobacco 
product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed 
in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or 
any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 
15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 
§ 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required 
for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of 
the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an 
order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco 
product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the 
manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered 
by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by 
FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 387e(j)(3)). A New Tobacco Product Without Required Marketing Authorization 
Is Adulterated and Misbranded FDA has determined that you manufacture, 
sell, and/or distribute to customers in the United States ZEN 
JUICE Absalom e-liquid product without a marketing authorization order. The 
e-liquid product listed above is a new tobacco product because 
it was not commercially marketed in the United States as 
of February 15, 2007. This product does not have an 
FDA marketing authorization order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of 
the FD&C Act and is not otherwise exempt from the 
marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, this product is adulterated under section 
902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In 
addition, it is misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other 
information respecting this product was not provided as required by 
section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. The doing of any 
act with respect to a tobacco product while such article 
is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which 
results in such product being adulterated or misbranded is a 
prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, to the extent that a report 
was required under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, the 
failure to provide such report is a prohibited act under 
section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)). 
Conclusion and Requested Actions FDA has not received an application 
from your firm requesting marketing authorization for the product listed 
in this Warning Letter. This product and any other new 
tobacco product on the market without the statutorily required premarket 
authorization are adulterated and misbranded and are subject to enforcement 
action at FDA’s discretion. It is your responsibility to ensure 
that all of your tobacco products comply with each applicable 
provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure 
to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
§ 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products 
including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, 
and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not 
limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this 
Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of 
section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco 
products offered for import into the United States that appear 
to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused 
admission. The violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily 
constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to 
address any violations that are referenced above, as well as 
violations that are the same as or similar to the 
ones stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring 
your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act. Please 
submit a written response to this letter within 15 working 
days from the date of receipt describing your actions to 
address any violations and bring your products into compliance, including 
the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or 
distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining 
compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that your 
products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include 
your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This 
letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with 
an opportunity to address them. You can find the FD&C 
Act through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov. Please note

Dear 
Mr. Roberts Jr.: The Center for Tobacco Products of the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions 
to the FDA and our inspection records, and determined that 
BS Vapes LLC manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for commercial 
distribution in the United States, and that the e-liquid products 
are manufactured and offered for sale or distribution to customers 
in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 
321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made 
or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain 
tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction 
under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1. Therefore, these products are 
required to be in compliance with the requirements in the 
FD&C Act. Please be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, 
FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition of a tobacco 
product, except accessories to these newly deemed products, to be 
subject to regulation under the FD&C Act. These products include, 
but are not limited to, electronic nicotine delivery systems (including 
e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, 
Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking 
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and 
Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco 
Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at 
https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. The FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have 
a premarket authorization in effect. A “new tobacco product” is 
any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the 
United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified 
tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 
(section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). 
Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a 
new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product 
submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding 
the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 
910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted 
a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions 
from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under 
section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)). 
A New Tobacco Product Without Required Marketing Authorization Is Adulterated 
and Misbranded FDA has determined that you manufacture, sell, and/or 
distribute to customers in the United States Grape Soda BS 
Vapes Nic 6 e-liquid product without a marketing authorization order. 
The tobacco product listed above is a new tobacco product 
because it was not commercially marketed in the United States 
as of February 15, 2007. This product does not have 
an FDA marketing authorization order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) 
of the FD&C Act and is not otherwise exempt from 
the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, this product is adulterated under 
section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). 
In addition, it is misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or 
other information respecting this product was not provided as required 
by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. The doing of 
any act with respect to a tobacco product while such 
article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce 
which results in such product being adulterated or misbranded is 
a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, to the extent that a 
report was required under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, 
the failure to provide such report is a prohibited act 
under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
331(p)). Conclusion and Requested Actions All new tobacco products on 
the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed 
unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. 
Products for which no application is pending, including, for example, 
those with a Marketing Denial Order and those for which 
no application was submitted, are among our highest enforcement priorities. 
For information on how FDA intends to prioritize enforcement resources 
with regard to the marketing of certain adulterated and misbranded 
ENDS and other deemed new tobacco products, please refer to 
the FDA’s guidance titled Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery 
Systems (ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the Market Without 
Premarket Authorization, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market. It is your responsibility to 
ensure that all of your tobacco products comply with each 
applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. 
Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 
U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco 
products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 
1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but 
not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, 
this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes

States United States WARNING LETTER Re: CMS # 644551 


Dear 
Mr. Paul Chen: On August 25, 2022 through September 19, 
2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a Foreign 
Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of Ruth Special Food Store 
LLC. located at 95 Washington Ave., Belleville, NJ 07109. We 
also conducted an inspection on May 28, 2021, through July 
27, 2021. These inspections were conducted to determine compliance with 
the requirements of section 805 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the 
implementing FSVP regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L. 
The FSVP regulation requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities 
to verify that human and/or animal food they import into 
the United States has been produced in a manner that 
meets applicable U.S. food safety standards. You may find information 
relating to the FSVP regulation and your responsibilities to comply 
with the regulation through links in FDA’s FSVP web page 
at: https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals. During the most recent inspection, we found that 
you are not in compliance with the requirements of 21 
CFR part 1, subpart L for the foods you import. 
Because of this significant violation, you are not in compliance 
with section 805 of the FD&C Act. At the conclusion 
of the current inspection, our investigator provided you with a 
Form FDA 483a FSVP Observations. We have not received your 
response to the Form FDA 483a that we sent to 
you on September 19, 2022. Your significant violation of the 
FSVP regulation is as follows: You did not develop, maintain, 
and follow an FSVP as required by section 805 of 
the FD&C Act and 21 CFR section 1.502(a). Specifically, you 
did not develop an FSVP for any of the foods 
you import, including each of the following foods: During our 
inspection, you stated you have not developed FSVPs for any 
of the foods you import. You also requested your suppliers 
provide their FSVP documents directly to FDA via email. On 
August 26, 2022, and September 7, 2022, our investigator received 
emails, which you also received as you were copied, with 
documents provided by your suppliers. The email from (b)(4), included 
a Cleaning Validation Procedure, Certificate of Analysis, Environment Monitor Control 
Program, Ethical Sourcing Procedure, Food Safety and Defense Plan, and 
three (b)(4) Analytical Reports from March 2022. The email from 
(b)(4), included an Inspection Certificate of Quality by Entry-Exit Inspection 
and Quarantine of (b)(4) and three (b)(4) Analytical Reports from 
May 2022. Although these documents could be relevant to development 
of an FSVP, you did not provide a record of 
your review of the relevant documents or explain how they 
would apply to your FSVP program. Thus, these documents do 
not constitute an FSVP as required by section 805 of 
the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 1.502(a). The above violation 
is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations 
of the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure 
that you are in compliance with section 805 of the 
FD&C Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 
1, subpart L. This letter notifies you of our concerns 
and provides you an opportunity to address them. If you 
do not adequately address this matter, we may take further 
action. For instance, we may take action under section 801(a)(3) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission 
of the food you import for which you appear to 
be in violation of section 805. We may place the 
foods you import into the United States on detention without 
physical examination (DWPE) when you import the foods. You can 
find DWPE information relating to FSVP in Import Alert # 
99-41 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or offering for 
importation into the United States of an article of food 
without the importer having an FSVP that meets the requirements 
of section 805 of the FD&C Act or the FSVP 
regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. 331(zz)). You should respond in writing within fifteen 
(15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your 
response should address the specific things you are doing to 
correct any violations. You should include in your response documentation 
and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections 
(e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as a copy 
of your FSVPs, records to demonstrate implementation of your FSVP), 
and any additional information that you wish to supply relevant 
to your compliance with the FSVP regulation. If you believe 
that you are not in violation of the FD&C Act, 
include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. 
If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 working days, 
you should explain the reason for your delay and state 
when you will correct any remaining violations. Please send your 
reply to Food and Drug Administration, Attention: David Trent-Carlson, Compliance 
Officer, Division of Northeast Imports: ORAOEIONEIMPORTSWLRESPONSES@fda.hhs.gov. Please also cc (carbon

34232-6247 United States United States WARNING LETTER December 9, 2022 
23-HAFE4-WL-02/CMS No. 642758 


Dear Mr. Peachey: The United States Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your ready-to-eat (RTE) ice cream 
manufacturing facility, located at 2001 Cattlemen Rd Unit 123, Sarasota, 
Florida, from July 19 to September 01, 2022. The inspection 
was initiated as part of a joint investigation with the 
Florida Department of Health (FL DOH) and Florida Department of 
Agriculture & Consumer Services (FDACS) of a multistate outbreak of 
Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) infections linked to ice cream supplied 
by your facility. According to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC), 28 ill people from 11 states were 
infected with the outbreak strain of L. monocytogenes. On July 
13, 2022, your firm recalled all ice cream products, lots, 
and expiration dates of Big Olaf brand ice cream through 
June 30, 2022, because they had the potential of being 
contaminated with L. monocytogenes. CDC and FDA have determined, based 
upon the epidemiological data and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) matches 
between clinical and FDACS environmental and finished product samples that 
ice cream manufactured at this facility was the source of 
this multistate L. monocytogenes outbreak. During the inspection of your 
facility, FDA found serious violations of the Current Good Manufacturing 
Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventative Controls for Human Food 
regulation (CGMP & PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal 
Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117). Based on our 
inspectional findings, we have determined that the RTE ice cream 
products manufactured in your facility are adulterated within the meaning 
of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)], in that they 
were prepared, packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby they 
may have been contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to 
health. In addition, failure of the owner, operator, or agent 
in charge of a covered facility to comply with the 
preventive controls provisions of the CGMP & PC rule (located 
in Subparts A, C, D, E, F, and G of 
Part 117) is prohibited by section 301(uu) of the Act 
[21 U.S.C. § 331(uu)]. You may find the Act and 
further information about the CGMP & PC rule through links 
in FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov. At the conclusion of 
the inspection, FDA issued a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, 
listing the deviations found at your facility. To date, we 
have not received a written response from you describing the 
corrective actions you have taken or plan to take at 
your facility. Multistate Outbreak of Listeriosis Linked to Big Olaf 
Ice Cream CDC, FDA, FL DOH, and FDACS investigated this 
multistate outbreak of L. monocytogenes infections linked to ice cream 
produced by Big Olaf Creamery. This investigation included 28 ill 
people in 11 states who were infected with the outbreak 
strain of L. monocytogenes. WGS was performed on Listeria bacteria 
from the 28 ill people and showed that the Listeria 
were closely related genetically to one another indicating that ill 
people became sick from consuming the same food. Fourteen ill 
people are residents of Florida, and eleven reported traveling to 
Florida prior to illness onset. Among 28 ill people with 
available information, 27 (96%) were hospitalized, and seven illnesses were 
in pregnant people or their newborns. One death and one 
fetal loss attributable to listeriosis have been reported. In interviews, 
ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and 
other exposures in the month before they became ill. Of 
23 people interviewed, all (100%) reported eating ice cream and 
16 (70%) specifically reported eating Big Olaf ice cream or 
at locations supplied by Big Olaf Creamery in the month 
before their illnesses started; one additional ill person reported eating 
ice cream more than one month prior to illness onset. 
This proportion is significantly higher compared to sporadic listeriosis cases 
not associated with an outbreak from the same states as 
ill people in this outbreak (p-value<0.0003). The overall epidemiologic data, 
illness sub-cluster information, and food histories of travelers to Florida 
strongly indicate that Big Olaf Creamery ice cream is the 
source of illnesses in this outbreak of L. monocytogenes infections. 
Furthermore, on July 7 and 9, 2022, FDACS collected samples 
(environmental swabs of your production environment and finished, packaged ice 
cream product), in which 10 environmental swab isolates and 20 
ice cream product isolates match the clinical outbreak isolates from 
2022 and 2021 based on WGS analysis. After the product 
recall and in response to FDACS’s positive L. monocytogenes environmental 
and finished product samples and FDACS’s stop sale order ceasing 
all sale of ice cream products, your firm contracted with 
a third-party laboratory to conduct environmental swabbing (b)(4). Multiple pieces 
of equipment used to manufacture RTE ice cream products were 
reported positive for L. monocytogenes by your contract laboratory, including 
(b)(4). Additionally, four swabs of finished product ice cream buckets 
((b)(4)) were reported positive for L. monocytogenes. L. monocytogenes is 
a pathogenic bacterium that is widespread in the environment and 
may be introduced into a food processing facility from raw 
materials, humans, or equipment. Without proper controls it can proliferate 
in food processing facilities where it may contaminate food. Therefore, 
it is essential to identify the areas of the food 
processing plant where this organism is able to grow and 
survive and to apply controls or take corrective actions as 
necessary to eradicate the organism. Consuming foods contaminated with L. 
monocytogenes can lead to a severe, sometimes life-threatening illness called 
listeriosis, which is a major public health concern due to 
the severity of the disease, its high case-fatality rate, its 
long incubation time, and its tendency to affect individuals with 
underlying conditions. The presence of L. monocytogenes in your facility 
and your products is significant in that it demonstrates your 
sanitation efforts are inadequate to effectively control pathogens in your 
facility to prevent contamination of food. Appropriate control of L. 
monocytogenes in a food processing environment requires knowledge of the 
unique characteristics of the organism and implementing the corresponding hygienic 
practices necessary to control this pathogen. Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based 
Preventive Controls (21 CFR Part 117, Subpart C) 1. You 
did not prepare, or have prepared, and implement a food 
safety plan, as required by 21 CFR § 117.126(a)(1). The 
preparation of the food safety plan must be overseen by 
one or more preventive controls qualified individuals (PCQIs), as required 
by 21 CFR § 117.126(a)(2). Your food safety plan must 
also include the following: 1) The written hazard analysis, as 
required by 21 CFR § 117.130(a)(2); 2) The written preventive 
controls, as required by 21 CFR § 117.135(b); 3) The 
written supply-chain program, as required by Subpart G; 4) The 
written recall plan, as required by 21 CFR § 117.139(a); 
5) The written procedures for monitoring the implementation of the 
preventive controls, as required by 21 CFR § 117.145(a); 6) 
The written corrective action procedures, as required by 21 CFR 
§ 117.150(a)(1); and 7) The written verification procedures, as required 
by 21 CFR § 117.165(b). However, you did not have 
a food safety plan with any of the required elements. 
For example, you did not conduct a hazard analysis to 
identify and evaluate known or reasonably foreseeable hazards for each 
type of the (b)(4) different RTE ice cream products manufactured, 
processed, packed, or held at your facility to determine whether 
there are any hazards requiring a preventive control (see 21 
CFR § 117.130(a)). Also, you did not identify and implement 
preventive controls to provide assurances that any hazards requiring a 
preventive control will be significantly minimized or prevented, and the 
RTE ice cream products manufactured, processed, packed, or held by 
your facility will not be adulterated under section 402 of 
the Act or misbranded under section 403(w) of the Act 
(see 21 CFR § 117.135(a)(1)). Preventive controls include, as appropriate 
to the facility and the food, process controls, food allergen 
controls, sanitation controls, supply-chain controls, and a recall plan (see 
21 CFR § 117.135(c)). Preventive controls are subject to preventive 
control management components (monitoring, verification, and corrective actions) as appropriate 
to ensure the effectiveness of the preventive controls, taking into 
account the nature of the preventive control and its role 
in the facility's food safety system (see 21 CFR § 
117.140). You must also validate that the preventive controls are 
adequate to control the hazard as appropriate to the nature 
of the preventive control and its role in the facility’s 
food safety system (see 21 CFR § 117.160). Specifically, for 
your RTE ice cream products: a) You did not identify 
and evaluate contamination with environmental pathogens, such as L. monocytogenes, 
as a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard to determine whether 
it is a hazard requiring a preventive control, to comply 
with 21 CFR § 117.130(c)(1)(ii). Your facility manufactures RTE ice 
cream products which are exposed to the environment during processing. 
The ice cream machine is (b)(4). Also, (b)(4). The packaged 
RTE ice cream products (b)(4) that would significantly minimize the 
pathogen. A knowledgeable person manufacturing/processing food in your circumstances would 
identify contamination with environmental pathogens as a hazard requiring a 
preventive control (i.e., sanitation controls). Sanitation controls include procedures, practices, 
and processes to ensure that the facility is maintained in 
a sanitary condition adequate to significantly minimize or prevent hazards 
such as environmental pathogens and biological hazards due to employee 
handling (see 21 CFR § 117.135(c)(3)). In addition, note that 
environmental monitoring is required if contamination of an RTE food 
with an environmental pathogen is a hazard requiring a preventive 
control (see 21 CFR § 117.165(a)(3)). b) You did not 
identify and evaluate allergens as a known or reasonably foreseeable 
hazard to determine whether allergens are a hazard requiring a 
preventive control. Your facility manufactures (b)(4) different RTE milk-based ice 
cream products, with a variety of flavors and inclusions. Some 
inclusions contain allergens (such as tree nuts (e.g., pecans), peanuts, 
and cookie pieces (wheat)). (b)(4). In addition, inclusions are (b)(4). 
These bins and scoops (b)(4). Therefore, allergens are a known 
or reasonably foreseeable hazard. A knowledgeable person manufacturing/processing food in 
your circumstances would identify allergens as a hazard requiring a 
preventive control. Food allergen controls include procedures, practices, and processes 
employed for ensuring protection of food from allergen cross-contact (including 
during storage, handling, and use) and for labeling to ensure 
that all food allergens required to be declared are included 
on the label (see 21 CFR § 117.135(c)(2)). c) You 
did not identify and evaluate bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella, 
as a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard in certain ingredients 
to determine whether they require a preventive control. Your process 
does not apply a (b)(4) step to any of your 
(b)(4). A knowledgeable person manufacturing/processing food in your circumstances would 
identify bacterial pathogens as a hazard requiring a preventive control 
in these ingredients, and because these hazards are controlled at 
your suppliers, the appropriate type of control is a supply-chain 
control. Further, a facility that identifies raw materials and other 
ingredients with hazards such as bacterial pathogens that require a 
supply-chain-applied control must establish and implement a risk-based supply-chain program 
for those raw materials and ingredients (see 21 CFR § 
117.405(a)(1)). The supply-chain program must include using approved suppliers and 
conducting supplier verification activities (see 21 CFR § 117.410). We 
note that you do not (b)(4). In addition, you do 
not (b)(4). During the inspection, you stated that Certificates of 
Analysis (COAs) are occasionally received from suppliers. The FDA Investigator 
reviewed a COA from a supplier, but you were unaware 
what this document represented. Note that Salmonella in ingredients such 
as RTE peanuts and tree nuts is a hazard that 
can cause serious adverse health consequences or death and thus 
an annual onsite audit is the appropriate supplier verification activity 
when the supplier controls the hazard unless there is a 
written determination that other verification activities and/or less frequent onsite 
auditing of the supplier provide adequate assurance that the hazard 
is controlled (see 21 CFR 117.430(b)). The audit must be 
conducted before using the raw material or other ingredient from 
the supplier and at least annually thereafter (see 21 CFR 
117.430(b)(1)(ii)). During the inspection, your firm provided a draft SOP 
that included various operational procedures intended to address food safety 
hazards associated with your manufacturing operations. It included a statement 
that going forward your firm will (b)(4). However, this draft 
procedure did not fully explain how you will ensure control 
of hazards requiring a preventive control in your ice cream 
products. For example: Further, to date, you have not submitted 
a response to the Form FDA 483, you have not 
indicated that you are implementing your draft procedure, or and 
you have not provided evidence that you have conducted a 
hazard analysis and developed a comprehensive food safety plan with 
the required elements. The violations in this letter are not 
intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that may 
exist at your facility or in connection with your products. 
You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of 
any violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or 
the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to 
ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal 
law, including FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to 
address the violations cited in this letter. Failure to do 
so may result in legal action without further notice, including, 
without limitation, seizure, injunction, or administrative action for suspension of 
food facility registration if criteria and conditions warrant. Please notify 
FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of 
this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to 
address these violations. Include an explanation of each step being 
taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as 
copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions 
within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay 
and the time within which you will do so. If 
you believe that your products are not in violation of 
the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for 
our consideration. Your written response should be directed to the 
Food and Drug Administration, attention to: Mr. Ramon Hernández, District 
Director, 466 Fernández Juncos Avenue, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00901-3223. 
You may email a copy of your response with appropriate

Dear John 
Gyorfi: The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed the website https://vapel1fe.com and 
determined that e-liquid products listed there are manufactured and offered 
for sale or distribution to customers in the United States. 
Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are 
tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco 
and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquids, 
are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 
1100.1. Therefore, e-liquids are required to be in compliance with 
the requirements in the FD&C Act. Please be aware that, 
effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the 
definition of a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly 
deemed products, to be subject to regulation under the FD&C 
Act. These products include, but are not limited to, ENDS 
(including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final 
Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family 
Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale 
and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for 
Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available 
at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. Generally, to be legally marketed in the United 
States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have 
a premarket authorization order in effect. A “new tobacco product” 
is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in 
the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any 
modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 
2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 
387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for 
a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the 
product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order 
finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product 
(section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer 
submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by 
exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA 
under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387e(j)(3)). New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated 
and Misbranded Our review of the website https://vapel1fe.com revealed that 
you manufacture and offer for sale or distribution to customers 
in the United States the following e-liquid products without a 
marketing authorization order, including, for example: Lollipop; Icy Blast; and 
Rain Dance. The e-liquid products listed above are new tobacco 
products because they were not commercially marketed in the United 
States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not 
have an FDA marketing authorization order in effect under section 
910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt 
from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated 
under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act. In addition, these 
products are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act 
because a notice or other information respecting these products were 
not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C 
Act. Conclusion and Requested Actions All new tobacco products on 
the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed 
unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. 
Products for which no application is pending, including, for example, 
those with a Marketing Denial Order and those for which 
no application was submitted, are among our highest enforcement priorities. 
For information on how FDA intends to prioritize enforcement resources 
with regard to the marketing of certain adulterated and misbranded 
ENDS and other deemed new tobacco products, please refer to 
the FDA’s guidance titled Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery 
Systems (ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the Market Without 
Premarket Authorization, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market. It is your responsibility to

the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter 
IX, relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 
21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may result in 
FDA initiating action, including, but not limited to, civil money 
penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not 
constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the 
FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import 
into the United States that appear to be adulterated or 
misbranded may be subject to detention and refusal of admission.

States United States November 28, 2022 RE: CMS CASE 640782 
WARNING LETTER 


Dear Mr. Millenkamp: An inspection of your beef 
cattle growing operation Mike Millenkamp Dairy Cattle located at 2065 
137th Street, Earlville, Iowa, was conducted by representatives of the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 2 and 
5, 2022. This letter notifies you of violations of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) that 
were revealed during our investigation of your operation. You can 
find the Act and its associated regulations on the Internet 
through links on the FDA’s web page at www.fda.gov. At 
the close of the inspection, you were issued a Form 
FDA 483, Inspectional Observations (FDA 483). We have not received 
a response to the FDA 483 as of the date 
on this letter. Adulteration of a New Animal Drug Our 
investigation found that you adulterated the new animal drug enrofloxacin 
(b)(4) by administering it to a beef steer, identified with 
ear tag (b)(4), without following the duration of use for 
the treatment as stated in the approved label. Specifically, you 
administered enrofloxacin 10 times during a thirty-day period starting on 
or about December 21, 2021 to treat a beef steer 
(ear tag (b)(4)) for Mycoplasma bovis. No approved drug containing 
enrofloxacin is labeled for multiple uses for the treatment of 
Mycoplasma bovis in cattle. Use of this drug in this 
manner is an extralabel use, as defined by Title 21, 
Code of Federal Regulations § 530.3(a) [21 CFR § 530.3(a)]. 
The only labeled use of enrofloxacin, for the treatment of 
Mycoplasma bovis in cattle, is a single subcutaneous dose followed 
by 28 days of withdrawal time. Under 21 CFR § 
530.41(a)(10), fluoroquinolones, which include enrofloxacin, are prohibited from extralabel use. 
Because your use of this drug was not in conformance 
with the approved label and labeling, you caused the drug 
to be unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 
21 U.S.C. § 360(b)(a), and adulterated within the meaning of 
section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5). 
The doing of any act to a drug after shipment 
of the drug and or/its components in interstate commerce while 
the drug is held for sale (whether or not the 
first sale) that results in the drug being adulterated or 
misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the 
FD&C Act [21 U.S.C § 331(k)]. Conclusion This letter is 
not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that 
may exist at your facility. You are responsible for investigating 
and determining the cause of any violations and for preventing 
their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is 
your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all 
requirements of federal law and FDA regulations. This letter notifies 
you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to 
address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may lead 
to legal or regulatory action without further notice, including without 
limitation, seizure and injunction. Within fifteen (15) working days of 
receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing 
of the specific steps that you have taken to correct 
any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken 
to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies 
of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 
fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for the delay 
and the time within which you will complete the correction. 
If you believe that you have complied with the FD&C 
Act and FDA regulations, include your reasoning and any supporting 
information for our consideration. Your written response should be sent 
to Danial S. Hutchison, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, 8050 Marshall Drive, Suite 205, Lenexa, KS 66214-1524. If 
you have any questions about this letter, please contact Compliance 
Officer Hutchison at 913-495-5154, or Danial.Hutchison@fda.hhs.gov.

95691-3806 United States United States WARNING LETTER WL 638942 


Dear 
Ms. Jollay: The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected 
your juice manufacturing facility, located at 2335 Del Monte Street, 
West Sacramento, CA 95691 on June 9, 10, 22, 24, 
and 29, 2022. We found that you have serious violations 
of the FDA’s juice Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point 
(HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 120 
(21 CFR Part 120). In accordance with 21 CFR 120.9, 
failure of a processor to have and implement a HACCP 
plan that complies with the requirements of 21 CFR Part 
120 renders the juice products adulterated within the meaning of 
Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act 
(the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)]. Accordingly, your juice products 
are adulterated in that they have been prepared, packed, or 
held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have been contaminated 
with filth, or whereby they may have been rendered injurious 
to health. You may find the Act, FDA’s juice HACCP 
regulations and the Juice HACCP Hazards and Controls Guidance through 
links in FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. To date, the 
agency has not received a written response from your firm 
regarding the violations noted on the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, 
which was issued to your firm at the conclusion of 
the inspection. The significant violations include the following: 1. You 
did not validate that your HACCP plan is adequate to 
control food hazards when a change in the process occurred 
that could have affected the hazard analysis or altered the 
HACCP plan in any way, as required by 21 CFR 
120.11(b). You were informed on June 1, 2022, that organic 
fresh strawberries (from “(b)(4)”) that you received were potentially contaminated 
with hepatitis A. You used these strawberries in the juice 
products (b)(4) and (b)(4) manufactured on (b)(4). During the inspection 
at your facility on June 9, 2022, you stated that 
after being notified of the potentially contaminated strawberries, you reviewed 
your production records to verify the implicated strawberries received were 
used only in the (b)(4) and (b)(4) juices. You also 
notified your processor who applies high pressure processing (HPP) as 
a treatment to produce the required minimum 5-log reduction, and 
you notified the produce supplier of the use of these 
strawberries in the (b)(4) products. Your Hazard Analysis and HACCP 
plan for “Cold Pressed Beverages,” dated September 30, 2021, did 
not identify hepatitis A as a hazard. In addition, your 
customer’s HPP process validation study that covers the juice products 
does not cover hepatitis A. However, you did not validate 
your HACCP plan before manufacturing subsequent lots of (b)(4) and 
(b)(4) on (b)(4). For example: 2. Your written hazard analysis 
does not consist of an identification of food hazards and 
an identification of the control measures that can be applied, 
as required by 21 CFR 120.7(a). a) Your hazard analysis 
for “Cold Pressed Beverages,” dated September 30, 2021, identifies “Vegetative 
pathogens (Listeria, Salmonella, E. coli)” as potential hazards but does 
not identify any control measures to produce the required minimum 
5-log reduction in the pertinent microorganism(s) in any of the 
juices and juice-based beverages that it covers. b) You use 
fresh apples and frozen unpasteurized not from concentrate (NFC) apple 
juice in several of your blended juices/juice products. You have 
not identified Cryptosporidium parvum as a food hazard in your 
hazard analysis for your apple juice products. Also, you have 
not identified any controls for the hazard. Furthermore, the associated 
HPP validation study which was used to establish the critical 
limits for HPP processing only considered Listeria, E. coli O157:H7 
and Salmonella spp. You manufactured “(b)(4)” and “(b)(4)?” juice product 
using fresh apples on (b)(4). 3. You must monitor the 
conditions and practices during processing with sufficient frequency to ensure, 
at a minimum, conformance with the current good manufacturing practice 
requirements in 21 CFR 117, Subpart B (CGMPs), that are 
both appropriate to your plant and the food being processed 
and relate to one of the areas specified in 21 
CFR 120.6(a)(1)-(8), to comply with 21 CFR 120.6(b). However, on 
June 9, 2022 you failed to monitor the conditions and 
practices during processing with sufficient frequency to ensure, at a 
minimum, conformance with CGMPs in the following areas: A. You 
failed to monitor handwashing with sufficient frequency to ensure that 
hands are washed thoroughly at any time when the hands 
may have become soiled or contaminated, as required by 21 
CFR 117.10(b)(3). This is related to prevention of cross contamination 
from insanitary objects to food, 21 CFR 120.6(a)(3). i. The 
employee who was setting up/assembling the (b)(4) did not change 
gloves or wash hands prior to loading the conveyor at 
the (b)(4) with celery stalks for the product, “(b)(4).” ii. 
The production manager did not wash his hands prior to 
donning gloves to enter production area to set up/stage bottles 
for the filler line. He put the disposable gloves over 
the cloth gloves he was wearing. He then grabbed these 
bottles to load the conveyor from the mouth of the 
bottle where his gloved fingers were touching the inside of 
the bottle. B. You failed to monitor the conditions and 
practices during processing with sufficient frequency to ensure that building, 
fixtures, and other physical facilities of the plant are maintained 
in a clean and sanitary condition as required by 21 
CFR 117.35(a). This is related to prevention of cross contamination 
from insanitary objects to food, 21 CFR 120.6(a)(3). i. An 
employee at the blending station used the employee hand washing 
station by the blending station to rinse a small bowl 
and a whisk used for mixing (b)(4) used in the 
products, “(b)(4)” and “(b)(4).” ii. A small plastic trash can 
for employees to dispose of gloves and paper towels at 
the hand washing station near the blending station was overfilled 
with trash. Strawberries were observed all over the floor around 
the trash can and red spots identified as liquid from 
discarded frozen strawberries were observed on the gloves located at 
the handwashing station. These gloves are for employee use during 
production. iii. There was an open ceiling tile above the 
filler line where uncapped bottles were being conveyed to a 
carousel table. iv. There was heavy dust build-up on power 
cords hanging off the ceiling above the open (b)(4) and 
the open (b)(4) that were in use. v. There was 
a rusty pipe located directly above the (b)(4). 4. You 
did not maintain sanitation standard operating procedure (SSOP) records that 
document the monitoring and corrections of conditions and practices during 
processing, as required per 21 CFR 120.6(c). a) Your “Food 
Allergen Control” SOP BQP-03-D, states under the Sanitation section as 
follows: “(b)(4).” The production records for April 28, 2022 show 
you used staging tank (b)(4) and the filler line to 
fill bottles of “(b)(4)” product, which contains coconut water. The 
record shows that the following products that do not contain 
coconut were filled on the filler line after “(b)(4) at 
(b)(4) at (b)(4) at (b)(4) at (b)(4). The “FILLER START-UP/CHANGEOVER 
CHECKLIST” used for monitoring the filler includes a box to 
be checked to “Verify Filler is Cleaned.” The form does 
not include fields to document the criteria (e.g., chemical concentration, 
temperature and time for treatments) required per your “Food Allergen 
Control” procedure. You stated you do not keep other records 
for monitoring the sanitation process between product changeovers. Furthermore, you 
stated you conduct a verification step by collecting swabs to 
test for coconut allergen after cleaning and sanitation and prior 
to producing the next product without the coconut allergen. However, 
your “ALLERGEN TESTING LOCATIONS” record dated April 28, 2022, shows 
that swabbing was completed at (b)(4). This time does not 
correspond with the production records that indicate at (b)(4) your 
firm had already started filling the next product, “(b)(4).” b) 
You do not maintain SSOP monitoring records for employee health 
conditions that could result in the microbial contamination of food. 
Additional Comments: You use (b)(4) in your “(b)(4)” and “(b)(4)” 
juice products. You identified the ingredient as a spice in 
your “Cold Pressed Beverages HACCP Plan.” In evaluating which food 
hazards are reasonably likely to occur, you did not consider 
the unapproved use of food or color additives as required 
per 21 CFR 120.7(c). There is no regulation in 21 
Code of Federal Regulation that permits the use of (b)(4) 
as a direct food additive or color additive, and we 
are not aware of a basis to conclude its use 
as an ingredient in food would be generally recognized as 
safe by qualified experts. Activated carbon is allowed for use 
in the manufacture of closure-sealing gaskets for food containers per 
21 CFR 177.1210; however, this is not applicable to your 
products as the (b)(4) is directly added as an ingredient. 
Further, you have not assessed (b)(4) for safety. Your ingredient 
supplier’s (b)(4) product label states, “Do not consume at the 
same time as any medicines or other dietary supplement, as 
this may interfere with their effectiveness.” FDA has evaluated the 
use of (b)(4) as an emetic poison treatment drug. Our 
review found that while it may be used in high 
doses, it can adsorb other nutrients or medications; therefore, it 
can interfere with the consumer’s medications or dietary needs. Additionally, 
(b)(4) can contain carcinogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbons and unsafe levels of 
heavy metals. Little is known about the safety of chronic 
consumption of (b)(4). If your use of (b)(4) imparts color 
to these beverages, it meets the statutory definition of a 
color additive at section 201(t) of the FD&C Act [21 
U.S.C. § 321(t)]. Color additives are deemed unsafe unless their 
use conforms with a regulation listing the color additive and 
describing the conditions for its safe use (section 721(a) of 
the FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. § 379e(a)]. There is no 
regulation authorizing use of (b)(4) as a color additive in 
food. Food that contains an unapproved color additive is deemed 
adulterated (section 402(c) of the FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. § 
342(c)]. The violations in this letter are not intended to 
be an all-inclusive list of the violations that may exist 
at your facility or in connection with your products. You 
are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the 
violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the 
occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure 
that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, 
including FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to address 
the violations noted in this letter. Failure to promptly address 
these violations may result in legal action without further notice, 
including, without limitation, seizure, injunction, or administrative action for suspension 
of food facility registration if criteria and conditions warrant. Please 
notify this office in writing within 15 working days of 
the receipt of this letter as to the specific steps 
you have taken to address these violations, including an explanation 
of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of 
violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you 
believe that your products are not in violation of the 
Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our 
consideration. In your response, you should include documentation, including revised 
procedures, photographs, results of tests you have conducted, and other 
useful information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections. 
If you cannot complete addressing these violations within 15 working 
days, state the reason for the delay and the time 
within which you will do so. Your written response should

33069 United States United States WARNING LETTER CMS# 638164 October 
6, 2022 


Dear Mr. Hennessey: During an inspection of your 
firm located at 3341 W. McNab Rd., Pompano Beach, Florida 
on February 3 through February 25, 2022, investigators from the 
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that your 
firm is a medical device manufacturer and distributor of the 
CovClear COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Tests and the ImmunoPass COVID-19 Neutralizing 
Antibody Rapid Tests (hereinafter collectively referred to as “COVID-19 Test 
Kits”). Based on our review, your COVID-19 Test Kits are 
intended for use in the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or 
cure of COVID-191 in people, and thus, are devices under 
section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(the “Act”), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h). Our inspection revealed that 
these COVID-19 Test Kits have been distributed in the U.S. 
without marketing approval, clearance, or authorization from FDA. Accordingly, the 
products are adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 
U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an 
approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to 
section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or 
an approved application for an investigational device exemption under section 
520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). These products 
are also misbranded under section 502(o) of the Act, 21 
U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm did not notify the 
agency of its intent to introduce the device into commercial 
distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 
U.S.C. § 360(k). The introduction or delivery for introduction of 
these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) 
of the Act, 21 U.S.C §331(a). In addition, it is 
a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the Act, 21 
U.S.C. § 331(k), to do any act with respect to 
a device while the device is held for sale after 
shipment in interstate commerce and results in the device being 
misbranded. Your ImmunoPass COVID-19 Neutralizing Antibody Rapid Tests and certain 
configurations of your CovClear COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Tests are also 
misbranded under section 502(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 
352(a), because labeling distributed with these products included statements that 
these products are authorized for use under an Emergency Use 
Authorization (EUA). These statements create a false impression that your 
products have been approved or authorized for emergency use by 
FDA and are misleading. As discussed above, none of your 
COVID-19 Test Kits have been approved, cleared, or authorized for 
emergency use by FDA. There is currently a global outbreak 
of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has 
been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The 
disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 
2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public 
health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions 
of HHS.2 In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was 
a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to 
COVID-19.3 Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers 
from certain products that, without approval, clearance, or authorization by 
FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 
in people. As described herein, you have distributed a product 
that is intended for use in mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, 
or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take 
immediate action to prevent distribution of such unapproved, uncleared, and 
unauthorized products for use in the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, 
or cure of COVID-19. For more information about FDA’s regulation 
of devices used to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure 
COVID-19; frequently asked questions; and other helpful resources, visit our 
website at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices. In addition, the guidance titled “Policy for 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (Revised)”4 
provides information about FDA’s policies intended to help expand testing 
capacity by facilitating the development and use of COVID-19 tests 
during the public health emergency. Our inspection also revealed that 
these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) 
of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the 
methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, 
their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity 
with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality 
System Regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR), Part 820. The violations observed are cited below. We 
received your responses dated March 18, 2022; April 8, 2022; 
April 15, 2022; and April 29, 2022, concerning our investigator(s) 
observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List 
of Inspectional Observations, that was issued to your firm on 
February 28, 2022. We address your responses below. Your response 
dated March 18, 2022, indicated that you are a small 
start-up seeking to market and distribute COVID-19 devices under Emergency 
Use Authorization in the United States. Your response references the 
FDA guidance document, “Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products and 
Related Authorities, Guidance for Industry and other Stakeholders” issued January 
2017 and that FDA may waive cGMPs on a case-by-case 
basis, and your response goes on to list some examples 
for products similar to your COVID-19 testing products. The guidance 
document that you have referenced also states “FDA generally expects 
that EUA products will be produced, stored, and distributed in 
compliance with CGMPs; however, limits or waivers may be granted 
in an EUA on a case-by-case basis, after consideration of 
the circumstances and of any alternative proposed approach.” However, as 
the devices which were distributed have not been granted EUA 
authorization, no such waiver of cGMPs has been granted to 
your firm. The violations include, but are not limited to, 
the following: 1. Failure to establish and maintain design control 
procedures in order to ensure that specified design requirements of 
the device are met, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(a). 
Specifically, your firm did not establish design control procedures prior 
to the distribution of the CovClear COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Tests. 
For example, Design validation activities and/or their documentation for the 
release of the CovClear Rapid Antigen Test were inadequate. The 
IFU document COVCLEAR SARS-COV-2 RAPID ANTIGEN TEST, LIT 900-027 REV 
1, (not dated), states in the DIRECT TEST SWAB PROCEDURE 
section (p. 4) to “read results within 3-20 minutes.” All 
the CovClear design verification and validation documentation reviewed revealed the 
time for reading the test results at 20 minutes. You 
must establish and maintain procedures to ensure that specified design 
requirements are met, this would include validating the device design 
to include reading results for the specified timeframe. If a 
user reads the results prior to the validated time, an 
incorrect diagnosis may result. Your design controls should ensure that 
the device’s specifications meet the intended use. Your response indicates 
that you have developed design control procedures that are compliant 
with the regulation. A follow-up inspection will be necessary to 
evaluate the effectiveness of your corrective actions. 2. Failure to 
adequately establish and implement corrective and preventive action procedures, as 
required by 21 CFR 820.100(a). Specifically, during review of your 
corrective action activities, your firm indicated that an internal audit 
/ gap analysis was conducted by a third-party auditor from 
May 20-24, 2021 that revealed major nonconformances to your quality 
system. Your Quality Department indicated that no systematic investigation to 
identify root causes of these reported issues or to identify 
similar quality issues was conducted; no corrective action plan was 
defined to systematically address the root causes; and no effectiveness 
verifications were conducted to address the deficiencies identified by the 
third-party auditor. Your response indicates that you have developed procedures 
that are to be compliant with the regulation and have 
conducted training. A follow-up inspection will be necessary to evaluate 
the effectiveness of your corrective actions. 3. Failure to adequately 
establish procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints by a 
formally designated unit, as required by 21 CFR 820.198(a). Specifically, 
your procedure QP 822, CUSTOMER FEEDBACK AND COMPLAINT HANDLING, Revision 
A, Effective June 22, 2020 until June 29, 2021 (Revision 
B) was inadequate in that the procedure did not include 
the requirement for complaints to be evaluated to determine whether 
the complaint is reportable. Additionally, a review of your complaint 
handling activities revealed that the contact phone number provided in 
your IFUs was directed to a commercial phone answering system 
monitored by the Marketing Department. There was no documentation of 
any follow-up with callers to determine if the inquiries constituted 
complaints. There were two notification transcriptions dated October 7, 2021 
and October 14, 2021 that appeared to require further investigation 
and were not forwarded to QA for investigation or evaluation 
of reportability. We acknowledge you have revised your procedure and 
have conducted training. A follow-up inspection will need to be 
conducted to evaluate the implementation and the effectiveness of your 
corrective actions. 4. Failure to adequately establish procedures for finished 
device acceptance, as required by 21 CFR 820.80(d). Specifically, Manufacturing 
Batch Record, MBR 900-005, Final QC Testing for Antigen Test 
which covers production lot number 02-365-03, lot size 1,270 kits/ 
50 test strips with expiration dates of February 14, 2021 
and June 2022 did not demonstrate the lot met the 
acceptance criteria for release, and this lot was distributed to 
customers in the United States. Your response indicates you have 
identified the root cause to be inadequate procedures lacking clearly 
defined acceptance criteria in the final QC testing MBR. You 
indicate you have updated the procedures, forms, and acceptance criteria, 
and have conducted training. Lot 02-365-03 was subject of the 
recall and product destruction will be documented within a CAPA. 
FDA witnessed the destruction on June 30, 2022. The implementation 
and effectiveness of your corrective actions will be reviewed during 
your follow-up inspection. 5. Failure to adequately establish procedures to 
ensure that all purchased or otherwise received product and services 
conform to specified requirements, as required by 21 CFR 820.50. 
Specifically, you did not ensure that your suppliers perform contracted 
processes that impact CovClear’s performance and effectiveness in a manner 
that guarantees your quality specifications are consistently met. A. The 
packaging process for the CovClear Rapid Antigen Test’s individually foil-wrapped 
configuration performed by your contract packager was not adequately validated 
to ensure that finished product will meet performance specifications during 
transportation, storage and use. B. Your firm indicated the Machinery 
Acceptance Declaration, approved August 5, 2021, used by your contract 
packager as the validation documentation, does not include any operating 
parameters, processing limits, component / raw material (foil) identification, nor 
does it demonstrate the validation accounted for potential process variations 
introduced by differences in operators or packaging material lots, or 
how the documentation applies to the CovClear packaging. Your response 
indicates that you have retained new regulatory and legal advisors 
and that you have developed purchasing control procedures that are 
compliant with the regulation. A follow-up inspection will verify the 
effectiveness of your corrective actions. 6. Failure to adequately establish 
and maintain document control procedures, as required by 21 CFR 
820.40. Specifically, your IFU document COVCLEAR SARS-COV-2 RAPID ANTIGEN TEST, 
LIT 900-027 REV 1, (not dated), and your marketing materials 
were observed to: lack the approval signature and date, the 
review for adequacy, and the change control within the quality 
system; and contain incorrect authorization status and or intended use 
for the CovClear Rapid Antigen Test. Your response indicates that 
you have identified the root cause and have taken corrective 
actions including: personnel changes and conducting a recall. You indicate 
that you are in compliance with the regulations. A follow-up 
inspection is necessary to determine the effectiveness or your corrective 
actions. Your firm should take prompt action to address any 
violations. Other federal agencies may take your compliance history into 
account when considering the award of federal contracts. Should FDA 
determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are 
reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, 
such devices will not be approved until the violations have 
been addressed. Should FDA determine that your devices or facilities 
do not meet the requirements of the Act, requests for 
Certificates to Foreign Governments (CFG) may not be granted. More 
information on processes for persons denied a CFG can be 
found at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/process-request-review-FDAs-decision-not-issue-certain-export-certificates-devices. Note, there are two response time frames 
specified. You should take immediate action to address any of 
the violations relating to your firm’s sale or distribution of 
the COVID-19 Test Kits and to prevent future violations. We 
advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other 
labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not 
misleadingly representing your products as safe and/or effective for a 
COVID-19 related use for which they have not been approved, 
cleared, or authorized by FDA and that you do not 
make claims that adulterate or misbrand the products in violation 
of the Act. Within 48 hours, please send an email 
to COVID-19-Task-Force-CDRH@fda.hhs.gov describing the specific steps you have taken to 
address any of these violations. Include an explanation of each 
step being taken to prevent the recurrence of any violations, 
as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot 
take action to address this matter completely within 48 hours, 
state the reason for the delay and the time within 
which you will do so. FDA is advising consumers not 
to purchase or use certain products that are not in 
compliance with FDA requirements and are being misleadingly represented as 
safe and/or effective for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or 
cure of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to a 
published list on FDA’s website of firms and websites that 
have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or 
distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the Act. 
This list can be found at: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulentcoronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-products. Once you have 
taken actions to address the distribution of your unapproved, uncleared, 
and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or 
cure of COVID-19, and any appropriate actions have been confirmed 
by the FDA, the published list will be updated to 
indicate that your firm has taken such corrective actions. Please 
also notify FDA in writing within fifteen business days from 
the date you receive this letter of the specific steps 
your firm has taken to address the concerns noted in 
this letter related to Quality Systems. Include documentation of any 
corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that 
your firm has taken. If any corrections and/or corrective actions 
will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation 
of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions your firm 
plans to take will require more time, please include a 
timetable for implementation of those activities. If any corrections and/or 
corrective actions your firm plans to take cannot be completed 
within fifteen business days, state the reason for requiring additional 
time and the time within which these activities will be 
completed. We will communicate with you regarding your firm’s response(s) 
and any need to re-inspect your firm’s facility to verify 
that any appropriate corrections have been made and/or corrective actions 
have been taken. This response should be sent via email 
to: Melissa Michurski, Director of Compliance Branch, at oradevices2firmresponse@fda.hhs.gov. Refer 
to CMS # 638164 when replying. If you have any 
questions about the contents of this letter, please contact: Demetria 
Lueneburg, ORA Division Compliance Officer at demetria.lueneburg@fda.hhs.gov or 612-758-7210. Finally, 
you should know that this letter is not intended to 
be an all-inclusive list of any deficiencies at your firm’s 
facility or associated with your firm’s devices. This letter notifies 
you of our concerns and provides you with an opportunity 
to address them. If you believe that your products are 
not in violation of the Act, please provide us with 
your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. It 
is your firm’s responsibility that the products you sell are 
in compliance with the Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure 
to adequately address the matters discussed in this letter may 
result in legal action, including without limitation, seizure, and injunction. 
The specific concerns noted in this letter and in the 
Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the 
inspection may be indicative of, or in addition to, other 
issues with your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems. Your 
firm should investigate and determine the causes of any deficiencies 
and take prompt actions to correct any violations and bring 
your products into compliance.

93012 United States United States WARNING LETTER December 16, 2022 



Dear Ms. De Rivel: Your firm was registered as an 
over-the-counter (OTC) human drug manufacturer. The U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration conducted testing of SnoreStop NasoSpray, Homeopathic Anti-Snoring Nasal Spray. 
This OTC drug product is labeled as distributed by your 
firm, Green Pharmaceuticals, Camarillo, CA. The results of the FDA 
laboratory testing of a batch of SnoreStop NasoSpray, Homeopathic Anti-Snoring 
Nasal Spray drug product demonstrate that this drug product is 
adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(1) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act or the Act), 
21 U.S.C. 351(a)(1), in that it consists in whole or 
in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance. In 
addition, the FDA has reviewed the records you submitted in 
response to our meeting on June 2, 2022, and follow-up 
correspondence regarding your manufacturing of the batch SnoreStop NasoSpray, Homeopathic 
Anti-Snoring Nasal Spray drug product tested. Our review determined that 
your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or 
holding do not conform to CGMP; therefore, your drug product 
is adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). In addition, the FDA reviewed 
the product label for Green Pharmaceutical’s “SnoreStop.” Based on our 
review, this product is an unapproved new drug under section 
505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355. Introducing or 
delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce violates section 
301 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331. FDA laboratory 
analysis determined that a sample of your “SnoreStop” product was 
contaminated with Providencia rettgeri. This contamination is particularly concerning because 
your “SnoreStop” product is a nasal spray and directed for 
use in children. Adulteration Violations FDA laboratory testing of SnoreStop 
NasoSpray, Homeopathic Anti-Snoring Nasal Spray drug product lot 2373/21222 found 
gross microbial contamination. The individual sample results varied between 420 
and up to 6200 colony forming units (CFU)/mL for total 
aerobic microbial count of and between 30 and up to 
3800 CFU/mL for total yeast and mold counts. Therefore, this 
homeopathic drug product is adulterated under section 501(a)(1) of the 
FD&C Act, in that it has been contaminated with filth, 
and has been rendered injurious to health. The labeling on 
your product indicates it may be used for children as 
young as five-years-old. The high bioburden in conjunction with the 
route of administration with this drug product poses a high 
risk of harm to vulnerable patients, including children. On June 
2, 2022, the FDA held a teleconference with you. During 
the call you stated that you receive bulk drug product 
from your contract manufacturer and that you further manufactured the 
drug by filling into the primary container, and further packaging 
and labeling it at your facility. You stated that you 
did not test your drug products, including for objectionable microorganisms, 
before release but rather relied on your contract manufacturer’s certificate 
of analysis for the bulk product. Failure to test these 
products for objectionable microorganisms is a violation of CGMP regulations 
for finished pharmaceuticals, 21 CFR 211.165(b) and section 501(a)(2)(B) of 
the FD&C Act. You stated that you started testing your 
finished products for microbial contamination only after the FDA informed 
you of the laboratory testing results. During the call, you 
agreed to conduct a voluntary recall of the lot currently 
in distribution to the U.S. market. Your firm released finished 
drug products without adequate testing for critical microbial attributes (i.e., 
testing to ensure absence of objectionable microorganisms). Without appropriate testing 
of each batch of drug product required to be free 
of objectionable microorganisms prior to release, as required under 21 
CFR 211.165(b), you did not have scientific evidence regarding the 
potential presence of microbial contamination that is objectionable in view 
of its intended use. Particularly for a drug product that 
is intended for use as a nasal spray, it is 
essential that your drug products are tested for microbial contamination 
to minimize the risk of patient exposure to significant numbers 
or harmful species of microorganisms, harmful microbial metabolites and/or toxins, 
and drug spoilage or degradation. On June 9, 2022, you 
conducted a voluntary recall of lot 2373/21222 of SnoreStop NasoSpray, 
packaged in 0.3 FL OZ (9ml) bottles, to the consumer 
level due to gross microbial contamination identified as Providencia rettgeri, 
as noted on the following FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/green-pharmaceuticals-inc-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-snorestop-nasospray-due-microbial#:~:text=FOR%20IMMEDIATE%20RELEASE%20%E2%80%93%20June%20 09,contamination%20identified%20as%20Providencia%20rettgeri In 
response to this letter, provide: Unapproved New Drugs Statements on 
the product label that establish the intended uses of your 
“SnoreStop” product include, but may not be limited to, the 
following: The above claims for “SnoreStop,” which is labeled as 
homeopathic, demonstrate that it is a drug under section 201(g)(1) 
of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because it is 
intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or 
prevention of disease, and/or intended to affect the structure or 
any function of the body. Moreover, this product is a 
“new drug,” as defined by 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 
21 U.S.C. 321(p), because it is not generally recognized as 
safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, 
or suggested in their labeling. With certain exceptions not applicable 
here, new drugs may not be introduced or delivered for 
introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from the 
FDA in effect, as described in sections 505(a) and 301(d) 
of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). No 
FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 
21 U.S.C. 355, is in effect for this product. Accordingly, 
this product is an unapproved new drug marketed in violation 
of sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 
U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). We note that “SnoreStop” is labeled 
as a homeopathic drug with active ingredients measured in homeopathic 
strengths. Under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
321(g)(1), the term “drug” includes articles recognized in the official 
Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States (HPUS), or any supplement 
to it. Homeopathic drug products are subject to the same 
statutory requirements as other drugs; nothing in the FD&C Act 
exempts homeopathic drugs from any of the requirements related to 
adulteration, misbranding, or approval. Use of Contract Manufacturers Drugs must 
be manufactured in conformance with CGMP. The FDA is aware 
that many drug manufacturers use independent contractors such as production 
facilities, testing laboratories, packagers, and labelers. The FDA regards contractors 
as extensions of the manufacturer. You are responsible for the 
quality of your drugs regardless of agreements in place with 
your contract facilities. You are required to ensure that drugs 
are made in accordance with section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C 
Act. For additional information regarding contract manufacturing, you may refer 
to FDA’s guidance document Contract Manufacturing Arrangements for Drugs: Quality 
Agreements at https://www.fda.gov/media/86193/download. CGMP Consultant Recommended Based upon the nature 
of the violations we identified at your firm, you should 
engage a consultant qualified as set forth in 21 CFR 
211.34 to evaluate your operations and to assist your firm 
in meeting CGMP requirements. The qualified consultant should also perform 
a comprehensive audit of your entire operation for CGMP compliance 
and evaluate the completion and efficacy of your corrective actions 
and preventive actions before you pursue resolution of your firm’s 
compliance status with the FDA. Your use of a consultant 
does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. 
Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies 
and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance. Conclusion The 
violations cited in this letter are not intended to be 
an all-inclusive list of violations that exist at your facility 
or in connection with your marketed product. You are responsible 
for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and 
for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. 
Correct any violations promptly. Failure to promptly and adequately address 
any violations may result in regulatory or legal action without 
further notice including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. Unresolved violations 
may also prevent other Federal agencies from awarding contracts. Failure 
to address violations may also cause the FDA to withhold 
issuance of Export Certificates. The FDA may withhold approval of 
new applications or supplements listing your firm as a drug 
manufacturer until any violations are completely addressed and we confirm 
your compliance with CGMP. We may inspect to verify that 
you have completed corrective actions to address any violations. This 
letter notifies you of our findings and provides you an 
opportunity to address the above deficiencies. After you receive this 
letter, respond to this office in writing within 15 working 
days. Specify what you have done to address any violations 
and to prevent their recurrence. In response to this letter, 
you may provide additional information for our consideration as we 
continue to assess your activities and practices. If you cannot 
complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state your reasons 
for delay and your schedule for completion. Please send your

TX 77380 United States United States WARNING LETTER CMS: 639553 
November 18, 2022 


Dear Dr. Venter: During an attempted inspection 
of your firm located in the Woodlands, TX on June 
17, 2022 through July 5, 2022, an investigator from the 
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that your 
firm markets, distributes and manufactures the CellQuicken Analyzer (Smart-Watch, and 
Software), RoyalVibe Ultrasound Generator, Envirovibe Water Restructuring Pad, Brainvibe Neuroplasticity 
Visual Program, RoyalVibe Therapy Balls, and RoyalVibe Application. Under section 
201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“Act” 
or “the Act”), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are 
devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis 
of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, 
treatment, or prevention of disease, or are intended to affect 
the structure or any function of the body. We have 
received your response via e-mail dated July 7, 2022, stating 
you will cease offering the RoyalVibe products for sale in 
the United States until you have achieved compliance with the 
regulations. However, your response does not address the previously marketed 
and distributed adulterated devices. You stated you have approximately (b)(4) 
customers with devices in the United States. Additionally, as of 
the date of this letter, your firm has several active 
product websites which appear to offer consumers the opportunity to 
purchase the products, and your companion software application is still 
available for download in the United States. In response to 
this letter, you should provide your plan for addressing the 
previously distributed adulterated products and provide details on the steps 
you’ve taken to remove your products from the US market. 
The FDA has reviewed your firm’s websites and attempted an 
inspection and determined that the devices listed above are adulterated 
under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), 
because your firm does not have an approved application for 
premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of 
the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application 
for an investigational device exemption under section 520(g) of the 
Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). The devices are also misbranded 
under section 502(o) the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because 
your firm did not notify the agency of its intent 
to introduce the devices into commercial distribution, as required by 
section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k). For 
a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 
510(k) is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before 
the agency (21 CFR 807.81(b)). The kind of information that 
your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval 
or clearance for the devices is described on the Internet 
at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/default.htm. The FDA will evaluate the information that your 
firm submits and decide whether the products may be legally 
marketed. Your firm markets the above referenced devices as a 
kit and as individual devices, intended for the diagnosis and 
treatment of several diseases including but not limited to cancer, 
Alzheimer’s, ischemic stroke, arthritis, and type 1 diabetes. Your firm’s 
product labeling includes claims which demonstrate the products are marketed 
for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. These products are 
devices under section 201(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 
321(h), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis 
of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, 
treatment, or prevention of disease, or are intended to affect 
the structure or any function of the body. For example, 
your website (www.royalvibehealth.com) promotes your firm’s products for, among others, 
the following intended uses: • “Diagnosed Condition’s Root Causes We 
Can Help Treat Cancer Type 1 Diabetes Type 2 Diabetes 
Cardiovascular Disease Alzheimer’s Kidney Disease Liver Disease Cerebrovascular problems (stroke) 
Lung Disease Depression” • “Breakthrough Cancer Treatment: A 90% Success 
Rate without Side-Effects” In addition, your RoyalVibe (www.royalvibehealth.com) and CellQuicken 
(www.cellquicken.com) websites contain, among others, claims and instructions for use 
(IFU) for the following devices: RoyalVibe Bioresonance Focused Ultrasound Generator 
Claims • “RoyalVibe Health uses ‘Bioresonance Focused Ultrasound’ technology and 
our therapy protocol help heal from different condition diagnoses, like 
Alzheimer's, Diabetes, Stroke, Cancer, and many others.” • “RoyalVibe Health 
uses a specific ‘Bio-Resonance Ultrasound Healing’ technology to target dangerous 
and toxic cells and help heal damaged and stressed cells 
that suffer from stress, bad diet, conventional treatments like chemotherapy, 
radiation, or other like from inflammation inside the body.” • 
“This technology and holistic approach can be effective for various 
conditions and even cancer stages, including stage 3 and stage 
4 cancer.” • “Does it work for any disease? Bioresonance 
Focused Ultrasound Treatment uses a sound vibration technology that can 
resonate with the vibration of any stressed, cancerous or healthy 
cell in your body. It means that it can help 
you heal from just about any unhealthy condition or imbalance 
that you may have within your body.” IFU • Screenshot 
of companion app lists protocols for “treatment Alzheimer,” “Ischemic Stroke,” 
“treatment Cancer,” and “treatments Arthritis.” • “The Electro Therapy Balls 
are used for direct contact. They are typically used to 
apply frequency directly to affected areas of pain and inflammation.” 
• “Connecting cables are used to connect the ultrasound transmitter, 
as well as the silver therapy balls to your RoyalVibe 
device.” Claims or statements that indicate that this product will 
use sound vibration technology to “resonate with” and heal damaged 
and stressed body cells, and can treat Alzheimer’s, diabetes, stroke, 
and cancer show an intent to treat disease or to 
affect the structure or any function of the body. See 
Act § 201(h)(2), (3), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h)(2), (3). Based 
on this, the RoyalVibe Bioresonance Focused Ultrasound Generator product is 
a device under section 201(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 
§ 321(h), because it is intended for use in the 
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or is intended 
to affect the structure or any function of the body. 
Envirovibe Water Restructuring Pad Claims • “Envirovibe Water Therapy (Heal 
Your Body Cells From The Inside Out)” • “Once you 
turn it on, it starts generating sound vibrations that create 
a perfectly structured, ready-to-drink water that heals and empowers your 
body cells in 10 minutes or less.” • “Water restructuring 
means the clustering of the water molecules is reduced for 
better absorbability in the cell.” • “In simple words – 
your cell gets more water with less effort, and that 
is crucial for effective communication and faster healing within your 
body.”IFU • “According to feedback from our clients, in addition 
to restructuring your water, the EnviroVibe has proven to be 
incredibly effective for treating pain; inflammation; wounds; broken bones; stomach 
ailments such as diarrhea or constipation, etc.” • “For example, 
you can place your EnviroVibe directly on your stomach and 
run the “CONSTIPATION SHORT” treatment found on Public Groupings, or 
place a broken leg on or next to your EnviroVibe

Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360, manufacturers of medical devices are 
required to annually register with the FDA. In September 2007, 
section 510 of the Act was amended by the Food 
and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-85) 
to require domestic and foreign device establishments to submit their 
annual establishment registration and device listing information to FDA by 
electronic means (Act § 510(p), 21 U.S.C. § 360(p)), during 
the period beginning October 1st and ending December 31st of 
each year. Our records indicate that your firm has not 
fulfilled annual registration and listing requirements for fiscal year 2022. 
Therefore, all of your firm’s devices are misbranded within the 
meaning of section 502(o) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 
352(o), in that the devices were manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, 
or processed in an establishment not duly registered under section 
510 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360 and were 
not included in a list required by section 510(j) of 
the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(j). We also note that 
an FDA investigator provided you with a Notice of Inspection 
on June 17, 2022, but you did not permit FDA’s 
inspection of your establishment located at 1095 Evergreen Circle, Suite 
200, The Woodlands, TX, 77530, and you did not respond 
to the investigator’s subsequent requests to inspect your establishment. You 
indicated that your firm uses this establishment as an address 
for customers in the United States to return their products 
for repair or replacement. Thus, you denied and/or limited an 
inspection of your establishment where your firm’s devices are processed, 
packed, and/or held (see Act § 501(j), 21 U.S.C. § 
351(j)). Your firm should take prompt action to address any 
violations identified in this letter. Failure to adequately address this 
matter may result in regulatory action being initiated by the 
FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not 
limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Other federal 
agencies may take your compliance with the Act and its 
implementing regulations into account when considering the award of federal 
contracts. Please notify this office in writing within fifteen business 
days from the date you receive this letter of the 
specific steps your firm has taken to address the noted 
violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm 
plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring 
again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which 
must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If 
your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over 
time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. 
If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen 
business days, state the reason for the delay and the 
time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s

CMS 638704 WARNING LETTER 


Dear Mr. Young: The U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your licensed 
medicated feed manufacturing facility located at 343 North Highway 24, 
Rupert, Idaho on June 13-17, 2022, and June 27, 2022. 
Our inspection revealed evidence of significant violations of the Current 
Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for 
Food for Animals (PCAF) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal 
Regulations, Part 507 (21 CFR Part 507) which cause your 
products to be adulterated.1 The doing of any act to 
a food or drug after shipment of the food or 
drug and/or its components in interstate commerce and while the 
food or drug is held for sale (whether or not 
the first sale) that results in the food or drug 
being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited act.2 Also, the 
failure of the owner, operator, or agent in charge of 
a covered facility to comply with the preventive controls provision 
of 21 CFR Part 507 (located in subparts A, C, 
D, E, and F of Part 507) is also a 
prohibited act.3 In addition, the inspection revealed evidence of significant 
violations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicated Feeds 
regulations, 21 CFR Part 225, which cause your medicated feeds 
to be adulterated.4 The inspection also revealed evidence of significant 
violations of the requirements for animal feed containing a veterinary 
feed directive (VFD) drug (VFD feed), 21 CFR Part 558.6, 
New Animal Drugs for Use in Animal Feeds. Failure of 
a facility to comply with the VFD requirements causes the 
resulting VFD feed to be unsafe within the meaning of 
the FD&C Act.5 A drug is adulterated if it is 
an animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug 
and the animal feed is unsafe.6 Furthermore, the failure of 
a facility to follow the VFD requirements causes the VFD 
feed containing a VFD drug to no longer be exempt 
from the requirements that its labeling bear adequate directions for 
use and as a result, the drug is misbranded under 
the FD&C Act if it does not bear adequate directions 
for use.7 In addition, if a medicated feed mill is 
required to obtain a feed mill license, that facility is 
also required to register as a drug establishment on an 
annual basis. Failure of a licensed medicated feed mill to 
register under Section 510 of the FD&C Act causes the 
animal feed manufactured in that facility to be misbranded.8 You 
are a licensed medicated feed mill and as of the 
date of this letter your facility does not have a 
current drug registration. You may find the FD&C Act and 
FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. 
At the close of the inspection, you were issued a 
Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations (FDA 483). We have not 
received a response to the FDA 483 as of the 
date on this letter. Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls 
Requirements Your animal food facility is subject to the hazard 
analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements found in 21 CFR 
Part 507, subparts A, C, D, E, and F. During 
the inspection of your facility, the FDA Investigators observed evidence 
of a significant violation of these requirements, which included: 1. 
You did not prepare, or have prepared, and did not 
implement a written food safety plan, as required by 21 
CFR 507.31(a). The preparation of the food safety plan must 
be overseen by your preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) and 
must include the following: a) The written hazard analysis as 
required by 21 CFR 507.33(a)(2). b) The written preventive controls 
as required by 21 CFR 507.34(b). c) The written supply-chain 
program as required by subpart E of 21 CFR Part 
507. d) The written recall plan as required by 21 
CFR 507.38(a)(1). e) The written procedures for monitoring the implementation 
of the preventive controls as required by 21 CFR 507.40(a). 
f) The written corrective action procedures as required by 21 
CFR 507.42(a)(1). g) The written verification procedures as required by 
21 CFR 507.49(b). Specifically, you told FDA investigators that you 
were working on a food safety plan, but it has 
not been completed or signed. You provided an undated, in-progress 
food safety plan and your consultant stated that hazards are 
still being identified to determine which hazards might require a 
preventive control. Additionally, at the close of the inspection you 
did not provide a timeline for completion and implementation of 
a food safety plan. Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Requirements 
Your animal food facility is subject to the CGMP requirements 
found in 21 CFR Part 507, subparts A, B, and 
F. During the inspection of your facility, FDA Investigators observed 
evidence of a significant violation of these requirements, which included: 
2. Your firm failed to evaluate raw materials and other 
ingredients susceptible to contamination with mycotoxins or other natural toxins, 
as required by 21 CFR 507.25(b)(2). Specifically, you do not 
have procedures or conduct testing to determine whether mycotoxins, such 
as aflatoxin, fumonisin, or deoxynivalenol (DON), are present in the 
ingredients you receive, store, and use in your animal food. 
During the inspection, you stated you do not evaluate incoming 
ingredients or finished product for mycotoxins. Grain and grain co-products 
used as components in cattle and swine food at your 
facility including, but not limited to, corn and dried distiller’s 
grains are susceptible to mycotoxin contamination. Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) 
Requirements Your animal food facility is subject to the VFD 
requirements found in 21 CFR 558.6. During the inspection of 
your facility, FDA Investigators observed evidence of a significant violation 
of these requirements, which include: 3. You manufactured and distributed 
an animal feed containing the VFD drug, Oxytetracycline, that did 
not comply with the terms of the VFD received for 
such drug, as required by 21 CFR 558.6(c)(2). Specifically, you 
manufactured (b)(4) batches of (b)(4) which had a super potent 
concentration of (b)(4) Oxytetracycline that was delivered to your customer 
on January 12, 2022, (Blend Ticket (b)(4)), and May 26, 
2022, (Blend Ticket (b)(4)). The drug concentration stated on the 
product labeling was listed as (b)(4) Oxytetracycline for these (b)(4) 
batches, neither of which conform to the VFD. The VFD, 
dated December 4, 2021, was for a concentration of 10 
g/ton Terramycin 100MR (Oxytetracycline). At the close of the inspection, 
you provided a revised label and Formulation Mix Report for 
(b)(4). The corrected label states a drug concentration of 10 
g/ton. However, the formula you provided continues to contain (b)(4) 
Oxytetracycline rather than 10 g/ton Oxytetracycline as specified in the 
VFD. Therefore, your correction does not satisfy the requirement in 
21 CFR 558.6(c)(2) that animal feed containing a VFD drug 
comply with the terms of the VFD. Current Good Manufacturing 
Practice for Medicated Feeds Requirements As a manufacturer of medicated 
feed for which an approved medicated feed license is required, 
your facility is subject to the CGMP for Medicated Feeds 
requirements found in 21 CFR 225.10 – 225.115. During the 
inspection of your facility, FDA investigators observed evidence of significant 
violations of these requirements, which included: 4. Your production records 
are not complete in that they did not include all 
the information required by 21 CFR 225.102(b)(2). Specifically, your Blend 
Tickets, which are your production records for medicated feeds, were 
incomplete in that they did not contain the following: date 
of production, quantity of each drug component used, the actual 
quantity of medicated feed produced, or the written endorsement by 
a responsible individual in the form of a signature or 
initials. 5. You failed to maintain on the premises the 
original or copy of a record of each oral or 
written complaint received relating to the safety and effectiveness of 
the medicated feed that you produced, as required by 21 
CFR 225.115(b)(1). Specifically, you do not maintain written records of 
complaints that are received by telephone and by customers communicating 
directly with their sales representatives. For each oral and written 
complaint, you are required to document the following: Your complaint 
records also must include all correspondence from the complainant and/or 
memoranda of conversations with the complainant, and a description of 
all investigations made by the manufacturer and of the method 
of disposition of the complaint. Misbranding 6. During the inspection 
of your facility, FDA Investigators found you failed to comply 
with the terms of the VFD for (b)(4) dated December 
4, 2021, for 10 g/ton Oxytetracycline, as required by 21 
CFR 558.6(c)(2). Failure to follow the VFD requirements causes the 
VFD feed to no longer be exempt from the requirements 
that its labeling bear adequate directions for use.9 The label 
you provided with the (b)(4) VFD feed does not bear 
adequate directions for use because it failed to include duration 
of administration and preparation for use (i.e., dilution)10, therefore, the 
VFD drug is misbranded.11 7. During the inspection of your 
facility, an FDA Investigator reviewed the animal feed labeling for 
Blend Tickets (b)(4) and (b)(4) and found evidence that the 
formulated product was misbranded because the labeling was false or 
misleading.12 Specifically, Blend Tickets (b)(4) and (b)(4) were custom formulated 
to contain Oxytetracycline at a concentration of approximately (b)(4). However, 
the labeling accompanying the animal feed stated that the Oxytetracycline 
concentration was (b)(4). This formulated concentration is approximately (b)(4) more 
Oxytetracycline than the labeled concentration. Conclusion This letter is not 
intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist 
at your facility or in connection with your products. You 
are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any 
violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of 
other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your 
firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA 
regulations. This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides 
you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address 
this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, 
seizure and injunction. We also have the following comment: During 
the inspection, our investigators also observed additional concerning CGMP conditions 
in your facility involving maintenance of your plant and grounds 
as well as sanitation of your facilities, equipment, and utensils. 
These conditions include: a. Build-up of unknown debris on animal 
food contact surfaces including your mixer in the bulk mixing 
plant and in the bed of a truck used to 
transport bulk feed. [21 CFR 507.22(a)(4)(iii)] b. Residual product and/or 
dust was observed in the air and settling on surfaces 
including the mixer and bagging equipment. [21 CFR 507.19(a)] c. 
Exposed insulation hanging from the ceiling and walls above and 
adjacent to bulk, uncovered ingredients. [21 CFR 507.19(a)] d. Birds 
were observed landing and feeding on bulk ground corn and 
bird feces was observed on exposed blood meal. [21 CFR 
507.17(c)] It is important to maintain your facility and animal 
food contact surfaces in a state where animal food products 
do not become contaminated or adulterated. For more information about 
FDA’s current thinking on the requirements of 21 CFR Part 
507, see: For more information about chemical hazards, including mycotoxins, 
see: For more information about FDA’s current thinking on the 
requirements relating to Veterinary Feed Directive Regulations, see: Please notify 
FDA in writing, within fifteen (15) working days of receipt

States United States Warning Letter November 22, 2022 


Dear Mr. 
Romeo: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your 
drug repackaging and relabeling facility, MD Pharmaceutical Supply, LLC at 
210 Poplar Street, Suite B, Hanover, PA from April 25 
to May 9, 2022. This warning letter summarizes significant deviations 
from current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) for active pharmaceutical ingredients 
(API). Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, 
packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your API 
are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 
351(a)(2)(B). We reviewed your May 25, 2022, response to our 
Form FDA 483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your 
subsequent correspondence. During our inspection, our investigators observed specific deviations 
including, but not limited to, the following. 1. Failure to 
adequately investigate and document complaints or any unexplained discrepancies with 
the original API manufacturer. Your firm did not adequately investigate 
customer complaints for returned API. For example, you were made 
aware by (b)(4) that phentolamine mesylate API lot# (b)(4) was 
returned to your facility for “quality issues.” Nonetheless, you redistributed 
the same lot of API to a different customer without 
performing an adequate investigation to assess drug quality. Additionally, records 
collected during the inspection indicated that 19 days after the 
redistribution of the same API lot, your supplier, (b)(4), instructed 
you to destroy the remainder of the API lot that 
remained in your inventory. In addition, FDA investigators observed a 
certificate of analysis (COA) for aminocaproic acid API lot# (b)(4) 
with an expiration date of April 19, 2024, that (b)(4) 
provided you for distribution. At the request of FDA investigators, 
you contacted (b)(4) for a copy of the COA for 
aminocaproic acid API lot# (b)(4) you distributed. (b)(4) provided you 
with a COA with a different expiration date of April 
19, 2023. You received COAs with disparate expiration dates for 
aminocaproic acid API lot# (b)(4). However, you did not initiate 
an investigation to assess whether the change in the expiration 
date was accurate and appropriate and whether the API lot 
you distributed with a year longer expiration date was scientifically 
justified. In your response, you stated that you have established 
a procedure, SOP MD#3-Returned goods, for handling returned goods. Your 
response is inadequate. You did not provide a retrospective review 
of your distribution operations, including product quality issues identified by 
your supplier to assess if other API are impacted. Your 
newly established procedure does not include storage condition verification for 
API that is returned to your inventory and redistributed. It 
is your responsibility to ensure that API returned to your 
inventory and redistributed has the identity, strength, quality, and purity 
that it is purported to have. In response to this 
letter, provide: 2. Failure to perform holding of API under 
appropriate CGMP to avoid loss of API identity or purity. 
You did not adequately monitor your API storage conditions. For 
example, the temperature probes you used to monitor your controlled 
substances storage area and refrigerator were not operational at the 
time of FDA inspection. In addition, you did not monitor 
your storage areas for humidity. You were unable to provide 
records for temperature and humidity monitoring to demonstrate that your 
facility held API under appropriate storage conditions that comply with 
manufacturers’ temperature and humidity storage requirements. In your response, you 
stated that you have established a procedure, SOP MD#5-Temperature and 
Humidity Controls, for temperature and humidity monitoring. Your response is 
inadequate. You did not provide information on how the probe 
locations you select to monitor temperature and humidly are representative 
of the worst-case environmental conditions of your storage areas. In 
addition, your procedure does not identify those responsible for performing 
the storage condition monitoring, and how the data will be 
controlled, maintained, and reviewed. In response to this letter, provide: 
3. Failure to perform repackaging and relabeling of API under 
appropriate CGMP to avoid mix-ups and potential cross-contamination. Your firm 
performed repacking and relabeling operations of API in an uncontrolled 
and open environment without adequate controls to prevent mix-ups and 
cross-contamination. For example, you relabeled Dasatinib monohydrate API and repackaged 
sirolimus API without label issuance, line clearance procedures, and documentation 
such as a batch record. Dasatinib monohydrate API is classified 
as highly potent and a toxic antineoplastic agent and sirolimus 
API is classified as an immunosuppressive agent. Both require appropriate 
handling and controls to prevent cross-contamination into other drugs. The 
drugs distributed by your firm were at risk for contamination 
and other hazards to drug safety because you failed to 
appropriately design your facility, establish effective procedures, maintain records of 
your activities, and implement robust controls. In your response, you 
stated that you will no longer perform repacking and relabeling 
operations. Your response is inadequate. You did not provide a 
retrospective assessment to ensure that no API distribution mix-ups or 
cross-contamination occurred. In response to this letter, provide: CGMP Consultant 
Recommended Based upon the nature of the deviations we identified 
at your firm, we strongly recommend engaging a consultant, qualified 
to evaluate your operations to assist your firm in meeting 
CGMP requirements. Your use of a consultant does not relieve 
your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive 
management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws 
to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance Drug Repackaging/Relabeling Cease We acknowledge 
your commitment to cease repackaging and relabeling of drugs at 
this facility. In response to this letter, clarify whether you 
intend to resume repackaging and relabeling operations of drugs at 
this facility in the future. If you plan to resume 
repackaging and relabeling operations of drugs, notify this office prior 
to resuming these activities. In addition, if you decide to 
transfer your ownership, contract out any processes, or move to 
a new location, notify this office prior to resuming your 
operations. Conclusion The deviations cited in this letter are not 
intended as an all-inclusive list of deviations. You are responsible 
for investigating and determining the causes of any deviations and 
for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other deviations. 
Correct any deviations promptly. Failure to address this matter promptly 
and adequately may result in regulatory or legal action without 
further notice including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. Unresolved deviations 
may also prevent other Federal agencies from awarding contracts. Failure 
to address deviations may also cause FDA to withhold issuance 
of Export Certificates. FDA may withhold approval of new applications 
or supplements listing your firm as a drug manufacturer until 
any deviations are completely addressed and we confirm your compliance 
with CGMP. We may re-inspect to verify that you have 
completed corrective actions to address any and deviations. This letter 
notifies you of our findings and provides you an opportunity 
to address the above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, 
respond to this office in writing within 15 working days 
(i.e. 12/15/2022). Specify what you have done to address any 
deviations and to prevent their recurrence. In response to this 
letter, you may provide additional information for our consideration as 
we continue to assess your activities and practices. If you 
cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state your 
reasons for delay and your schedule for completion. Send your

United States United States WARNING LETTER June 1, 2022 Re: 
CMS 631972 


Dear Mr. Martin Vera: On March 18, 2022 
to March 30, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
conducted a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of your 
firm Supreme Fruit Produce, Inc. located at 1915 Valance St., 
San Diego, CA 92154-4287. We also conducted an inspection on 
October 13, 2020 to October 21, 2020. These inspections were 
conducted to determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 
of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) 
(21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 
CFR part 1, subpart L. The FSVP regulation requires that 
importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or 
animal food they import into the United States has been 
produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety 
standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP regulation 
and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links 
in FDA’s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals. During the most 
recent inspection, we found that you are not in compliance 
with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart L 
for the foods you import, including fresh Chayote, fresh Serrano 
peppers, and fresh coconuts imported from (b)(4). Because of these 
significant violations, you are not in compliance with section 805 
of the FD&C Act. At the conclusion of the most 
recent inspection, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 
483a FSVP Observations. We acknowledge receipt of your response dated 
April 8, 2022, and we address your response below. Your 
response included a brief narrative summary of corrective actions your 
firm plans to implement. The response indicated that your firm 
should have an FSVP for the three food products covered 
in the most recent inspection by the “end of July 
2022” and that your firm “will start working on an 
FSVP for each product/supplier [you] use.” We evaluated your response 
and find it inadequate because you did not provide further 
details or documentation regarding implementation of an FSVP program for 
the products you continue to import. Your significant violations of 
the FSVP regulation are as follows: You did not develop, 
maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by section 805 
of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 1.502(a). Specifically, 
your firm did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP 
for any foods that you import, including each of the 
following foods: The above violations are not intended to be 
an all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. It 
is your responsibility to ensure that you are in compliance 
with section 805 of the FD&C Act and the implementing 
regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L. This letter 
notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity 
to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may 
result in further action. For instance, we may take action 
under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the food products you import. 
We may place the foods you import on detention without 
physical examination (DWPE) when you import the foods. You can 
find DWPE information relating to FSVP in Import Alert # 
99-41 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or offering for 
importation into the United States of an article of food 
without the importer having an FSVP that meets the requirements 
of section 805 of the FD&C Act or the FSVP 
regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 331(zz)). Additionally, we offer the following comment: 
You import fresh produce, which is “covered produce” as defined 
in 21 CFR 112.3. Your FSVP must demonstrate that your 
supplier is producing the food in compliance with processes and 
procedures that provide at least the same level of public 
health protection as those required under section 419 of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 350h) (regarding standards for produce 
safety) and the implementing regulations in the Standards for the 
Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption 
(21 CFR part 112). You should respond in writing within 
fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. 
Your response should address the specific things you are doing 
to correct any violations. You should include in your response 
documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your 
corrections, (e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as a 
copy of your FSVP, records to demonstrate implementation of your 
FSVP), and any additional information that you wish to supply 
relevant to your compliance with the FSVP regulation. If you 
believe that you are not in violation of the FD&C 
Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our 
consideration. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, 
you should explain the reason for your delay and state 
when you will correct any remaining violations. Please send your 
reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: CDR Toby 
H. Hill, Compliance Officer, Division of Southwest Imports, One Main 
Place, 1201 Main Street, Suite 7200, Dallas, TX 75202. If 
you have any questions regarding this letter, you may contact

Warning Letter 320-23-09 December 16, 2022 


Dear Mr. Geng: Your 
facility was registered with the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA or Agency) as a manufacturer of over-the-counter (OTC) 
drug products, including consumer antiseptic hand rub drug products (also 
referred to as consumer hand sanitizers), until August 25, 2022. 
FDA has reviewed the records you submitted in response to 
our October 19, 2021, request for records and other information 
pursuant to section 704(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 374(a)(4)) for your facility, 
Superior Glove Works, Ltd., FEI 3006217765, at 36 Vimy St., 
Acton, Ontario. This warning letter summarizes significant violations of Current 
Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 
21 Code of Federal Regulations, parts 210 and 211 (21 
CFR, parts 210 and 211). Because your methods, facilities, or 
controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding drugs as described 
in your response to our 704(a)(4) request do not conform 
to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning 
of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B))1. 
Adulteration Violations Synergy Hand Sanitizer (HS) Alcohol Antiseptic 80% Topical 
Solution and Synergy Hand Sanitizer with Aloe (HSA) Alcohol Antiseptic 
70 % Topical Solution were manufactured at your facility. One 
of the supplier’s Certificates of Analysis (COA) you provided in 
response to our 704(a)(4) request for records and other information 
demonstrates that ethanol API used to manufacture your drug products 
in U.S. distribution contained impurities at unacceptable levels. Acetaldehyde impurities 
were found to be 205 parts per million (ppm) and 
the sum of all impurities were found to be 2,846 
ppm. Acetaldehyde appears to be genotoxic, and potentially carcinogenic, when 
in direct contact with tissues. On August 30, 2022, FDA 
held a teleconference with you. We recommended you consider removing 
any batches of Synergy Hand Sanitizer (HS) Alcohol Antiseptic 80% 
Topical Solution drug product currently in distribution from the U.S. 
market which may have been manufactured using the ethanol API 
that contained impurities at unacceptable levels. On September 1, 2022, 
you issued a voluntary nationwide recall of one batch of 
Synergy Hand Sanitizer (HS) Alcohol Antiseptic 80% Topical Solution due 
to the presence of acetaldehyde impurities and the sum of 
all impurities at unacceptable levels. The contamination with acetaldehyde and 
other unidentified impurities in the drug product manufactured in your 
facility, in addition to the significant violations observed in the 
704(a)(4) record request, demonstrate that the quality assurance within your 
facility is not functioning in accordance with CGMP requirements under 
section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act. 704(a)(4) Request for Records 
and Related CGMP Violations Following review of records and other 
information provided pursuant to section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 
significant violations were observed including, but not limited to, the 
following: 1. Your firm failed to conduct at least one 
test to verify the identity of each component of a 
drug product (21 CFR 211.84(d)(1)). Your response to our request 
for records and other information under section 704(a)(4) indicated that 
you did not adequately test incoming components used in the 
manufacture of your drug products before release and distribution to 
the United States. Specifically, in response to our request to 
provide details about your raw material incoming and identity testing 
for each lot of each component of the API for 
your hand sanitizer you state that you “do not test 
methanol content in incoming ethanol”, you do not perform identity 
testing of raw materials, and that “incoming materials are required 
to be accompanied by COA”. You further indicated in your 
response that you used (b)(4) suppliers of ethanol API to 
manufacture your hand sanitizer drug products. However, no impurity testing 
specifications (benzene, methanol, acetal, acetaldehyde, etc.) were listed on COAs 
from (b)(4) of your ethanol API suppliers, and the COA 
from a (b)(4) supplier had impurity levels (acetaldehyde 900ppm max 
and sum of all impurities 5000ppm max) that were above 
acceptable levels. Acetaldehyde and acetal are known impurities of alcohol, 
as delineated in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). The USP 
monograph for alcohol limits acetaldehyde and acetal to not more 
than (NMT) 10mL/L, 10 ppm (expressed as acetaldehyde). Alcohol not 
meeting the specification for acetaldehyde and acetal is deemed adulterated 
under section 501(b) of the FD&C Act. Alcohol represents a 
significant component of your drug product; therefore, you must have 
a specification for acetaldehyde and acetal per 21 CFR 211.160(b). 
Component testing is fundamental to quality. Without adequate testing, you 
do not have scientific evidence that your raw materials conform 
to appropriate specifications before use in the manufacture of your 
drug products. In response to this letter, provide: 2. Your 
firm failed to have, for each batch of drug product, 
appropriate laboratory determination of satisfactory conformance to final specifications for 
the drug product, including the identity and strength of each 
active ingredient, prior to release (21 CFR 211.165(a)). Based on 
the records and information you provided, you did not demonstrate 
that you adequately test your finished OTC drug products prior 
to release, including over 90 shipments of hand sanitizer drug 
products distributed to the United States, as there is no 
indication that you test for known impurities present in your 
raw materials. For example, we requested that you provide the 
test results of all finished batches of hand sanitizer that 
had been shipped to or distributed in the United States. 
The records you provided in your response indicated that you 
have only performed limited release testing as part of the 
production record (viscosity for HSA drug products and final potency 
of alcohol content for both HS and HSA drug products). 
Full release testing, including for identity, strength, and impurities, must 
be performed prior to drug release and distribution. Without adequate 
testing, there is no scientific evidence to assure that your 
drug products conform to appropriate specifications before release. In response 
to this letter, provide: o An action plan and timelines 
for conducting full chemical and microbiological testing of reserve samples 
to determine the quality of all batches of drug product 
distributed to the United States that are within expiry as 
of the date of this letter. o A summary of 
all results obtained from testing reserve samples from each batch. 
If such testing reveals substandard quality drug products, take rapid 
corrective actions, such as notifying customers and product recalls. 3. 
Your firm failed to establish adequate written procedures for production 
and process control designed to assure that the drug products 
you manufacture have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they 
purport or are represented to possess (21 CFR 211.100(a)). Based 
on the information you provided, you did not demonstrate that 
your manufacturing processes are reproducible and controlled to yield a 
product of uniform character and quality. For example, your batch 
records did not include any process parameters or in-process specifications 
to demonstrate control in the manufacture of your OTC hand 
sanitizer drug products. Additionally, there were deficiencies in your production 
documentation including, but were not limited to: In response to 
this letter, provide: Superior Glove Works, Ltd., Acton FEI 3006217765 
page 5 Conclusion The violations cited in this letter are 
not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that 
exist at your facility. You are responsible for investigating and 
determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their 
recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. Note that FDA 
placed all drugs and drug products manufactured by your firm 
on Import Alert 66-40 on September 27, 2022, as the 
methods used in and controls used for the manufacture, processing, 
packing, or holding of these products do not appear to 
conform to current good manufacturing practices within the meaning of 
section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act. Drugs and drug products 
that appear to be adulterated or misbranded may be detained 
or refused admission without physical examination pursuant to section 801(a)(3) 
of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3). All drugs and 
drug products manufactured by your firm may remain listed on 
this import alert until there is evidence establishing that the 
conditions that gave rise to the appearance of a violation 
have been resolved, and the Agency has confidence that future 
entries will be in compliance with the FD&C Act. This 
may include an inspection prior to the Agency considering the 
appearance of adulteration to be addressed. This letter notifies you 
of our findings and provides you an opportunity to address 
the above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, respond to 
this office in writing within 15 working days. Specify what 
you have done to address any violations and to prevent 
their recurrence. In response to this letter, you may provide 
additional information for our consideration as we continue to assess 
your activities and practices. If you cannot complete corrective actions 
within 15 working days, state your reasons for delay and 
your schedule for completion. Send your electronic reply to CDER-OC-OMQ-Communications@fda.hhs.gov.

of Compliance Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Cc: Hubert 
Parsons - hubert.parsons@superiorglove.com(b)(4) __________________________ 1 Due to an increased demand 
for alcohol-based hand sanitizers during the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA published 
the Guidance for Industry: Temporary Policy for Preparation of Certain 
Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the Public Health Emergency (COVID-19) 
on March 19, 2020, and subsequently updated the guidance several 
times. The guidance was withdrawn effective December 31, 2021 (86 
Fed Reg at 56960). This guidance communicated the Agency’s temporary 
policy that we did not intend to take action against 
firms for CGMP violations under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C 
Act if such firms prepared alcohol-based hand sanitizers for consumer 
use (or for use as a health care personnel hand 
rub) during the public health emergency, provided certain circumstances described 
in the guidance are present. These circumstances included preparation of 
hand sanitizer products using only the ingredients and formulas set 
forth in the guidance. Because Superior Glove Works, Ltd. hand 
sanitizer drug products were not consistent with the formulations described 
in these guidances, they did not fall within any temporary 
Agency policy not to take action against firms manufacturing hand 
sanitizer products for violations of section 505 of the FD&C

Food and Drug Administration RE: Notice of Unlawful Sale of 
Unapproved and Misbranded Drugs to United States Consumers Over the 
Internet DATE: December 27, 2022 WARNING LETTER This is to 
advise you that the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) recently reviewed your website at the Internet address 
www.globalpharmacyplus.com and has observed that your website introduces into interstate 
commerce misbranded and unapproved new drugs in violation of sections 
301(a), 301(d), and 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(a), 331(d), and 
355(a)]. There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease 
caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by 
the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On 
January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related 
to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.1 In 
addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration 
of a national emergency in response to COVID-19.2 Therefore, FDA 
is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products 
that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, 
prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As discussed 
below, FDA has observed that www.globalpharmacyplus.com offers drug products for 
sale in the U.S. that are intended to mitigate, prevent, 
treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19. FDA has also observed that 
www.globalpharmacyplus.com introduces into interstate commerce unapproved and misbranded drugs for 
which the FDA-approved version is subject to a Risk Evaluation 
and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program. A REMS is a drug 
safety program that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
can require for certain medications with serious safety concerns to 
help ensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks. 
REMS are designed to reinforce medication use behaviors and actions 
that support the safe use of that medication. In addition, 
FDA has observed that www.globalpharmacyplus.com introduces into interstate commerce unapproved 
and misbranded drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index (NTI). 
NTI drugs are drugs where small differences in dose or 
blood concentration may lead to serious therapeutic failures and/or adverse 
drug reactions that are life-threatening or result in persistent or 
significant disability or incapacity. Substituting an NTI drug without the 
U.S. prescriber’s direction poses significant health risks to patients. Given 
the serious safety concerns with these products, the easy availability 
of these products via the Internet poses significant risks to 
U.S. consumers. There are inherent risks to consumers who purchase 
unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs. Unapproved new drugs do 
not carry the same assurances of safety and effectiveness as 
those drugs subject to FDA oversight. Drugs that have circumvented 
regulatory safeguards may be contaminated, counterfeit, contain varying amounts of 
active ingredients, or contain different ingredients altogether. Accordingly, FDA requests 
that www.globalpharmacyplus.com cease offering any unapproved or misbranded drugs for 
sale to U.S. consumers. This is critical to shielding the 
American public from harm. Unapproved New Drugs: Certain products offered 
for sale by www.globalpharmacyplus.com are drugs within the meaning of 
section 201(g) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)] 
because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, 
mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or because they are 
intended to affect the structure or function of the body. 
These drugs are also new drugs as defined by section 
201(p) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)], because 
they are not generally recognized as safe and effective for 
their labeled uses. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new 
drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction 
into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described 
in section 505(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 
355(a)]. No approved applications pursuant to section 505 of the 
FD&C Act are in effect for these products. Accordingly, their 
introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce violates sections 
301(d) [21 U.S.C. § 331(d)] and 505(a) of the FD&C 
Act. For example, www.globalpharmacyplus.com offers molnupiravir marketed as “Molnunat 200.” 
Your website states, “Molnupiravir is an oral medication, that is 
authorized by the FDA to treat Covid-19. Molnupiravir is active 
against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Early treatment 
with the drug reduces the risk of hospitalization or death 
in at-risk patients that have or have not been vaccinated.” 
There are no approved drug applications pursuant to section 505 
of the FD&C Act in effect for the “Molnunat 200” 
offered by www.globalpharmacyplus.com. Moreover, while there is an FDA-authorized version 
of molnupiravir currently available in the U.S. under an emergency 
use authorization (EUA) pursuant to section 564 of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. 21 U.S.C. §360bbb-3), FDA has not authorized 
for emergency use the “Molnunat 200” offered by www.globalpharmacyplus.com.3 FDA-authorized 
molnupiravir is an unapproved drug for which FDA has issued 
an EUA for emergency use for the treatment of mild-to-moderate 
COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression 
to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom 
alternative COVID-19 treatment options approved or authorized by FDA are 
not accessible or clinically appropriate. Your website also offers mycophenolate 
mofetil marketed as “CellCept 500mg” tablets. Your website states, “CellCept, 
brand name product by Roche is used to prevent your 
body from rejecting a kidney, liver, or heart transplant. CellCept 
(mycophenolate mofetil) lowers your body’s immune system.” While there are 
FDA-approved versions of mycophenolate mofetil tablets, including CellCept, on the 
market in the U.S., there are no approved drug applications 
pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act in effect 
for the “CellCept 500mg” tablets offered by www.globalpharmacyplus.com. FDA-approved mycophenolate 
mofetil tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection 
in recipients of allogeneic kidney, heart or liver transplants, in 
combination with other immunosuppressants. FDA-approved mycophenolate mofetil products, including mycophenolate 
mofetil tablets, are subject to a REMS program that requires 
healthcare providers to report pregnancies to a registry and includes 
an educational component regarding fetal toxicity. FDA-approved mycophenolate mofetil also 
bears a boxed warning, commonly referred to as a “black 
box warning,” which is the strongest warning FDA requires, indicating 
that the drug carries a significant risk of serious or 
even life-threatening adverse effects. The boxed warning addresses the increased 
risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and congenital malformations, increased 
risk of developing lymphoma and other malignancies, and the increased 
susceptibility to infection. Additionally, www.globalpharmacyplus.com offers tacrolimus pictured as “Tacrolimus 
Capsules Tacrograf – 0.5”. Your website states, “Prograf (Tacrolimus) is 
used to lower the body’s immune system to help fight 
infections. Tacrolimus is most widely used on organ transplant recipients 
to have a better chance of the organ to be 
accepted in their body.” Your website also states, “Generic Prograf 
is used together with other medications to prevent your body 
from rejecting organs such as heart, liver, or kidney transplant.” 
While there are FDA-approved versions of tacrolimus on the market 
in the U.S., there are no approved drug applications pursuant 
to section 505 of the FD&C Act in effect for 
the “Tacrolimus Capsules Tacrograf – 0.5” offered by www.globalpharmacyplus.com. Capsules 
of tacrolimus administered orally are NTI drugs. FDA-approved tacrolimus capsules 
are indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult 
and pediatric patients receiving certain transplants, in combination with other 
immunosuppressants. FDA-approved tacrolimus bears a boxed warning addressing an increased 
risk for developing serious infections and malignancies with tacrolimus or 
other immunosuppressants that may lead to hospitalization or death. Misbranded 
Drugs: A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the 
FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if its labeling fails 
to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” 
means directions under which a layperson can use a drug 
safely and for the purposes for which it is intended 
(see 21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 
503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)] include 
those that, because of their toxicity or other potentiality for 
harmful effect, or the method of their use, or the 
collateral measures necessary for their use, are not safe for 
use except under supervision of a practitioner licensed by law 
to administer them. Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1) 
of the FD&C Act, can be used safely only at 
the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. 
Because the aforementioned drugs are prescription drugs intended for conditions 
that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by a 
layperson, adequate directions cannot be written such that a layperson 
can use the products safely for the intended uses. Consequently, 
the labeling for these drugs fails to bear adequate directions 
for use, causing them to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) 
of the FD&C Act. In addition, because the drugs are 
not approved in the U.S., they are also not exempt 
under 21 CFR 201.115(a) from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) 
of the FD&C Act. By offering these drugs for sale 
to U.S. consumers, www.globalpharmacyplus.com is causing the introduction of misbranded 
drugs into interstate commerce in violation of section 301(a) of 
the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)]. These drugs are 
also misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act [21 
U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)] because they fail to bear “adequate warnings 
against use…where [their] use may be dangerous to health, or 
against unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration or 
application....” This is particularly concerning because, as noted above, FDA-approved 
mycophenolate mofetil products, including CellCept, are subject to a REMS 
program to mitigate the risk of embryofetal toxicity associated with 
use of mycophenolate during pregnancy. Your website www.globalpharmacyplus.com is causing 
important safety measures that are put in place for the 
FDA-approved versions of this drug to be bypassed. FDA is 
sending this Warning Letter to www.globalpharmacyplus.com because of the inherent 
risks to consumers who purchase misbranded and unapproved new drugs. 
This letter is not intended to identify all the ways 
in which your products or operations might be in violation 
of the law. It is your responsibility to ensure that 
all products you offer for sale are in compliance with 
the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. You should take 
prompt action to address any violations of the FD&C Act 
(which may include the offer for sale of similarly misbranded 
and/or unapproved new drugs other than the drugs noted above). 
We advise you to review your website, product labels, and 
other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are 
not misleadingly representing your products as safe and effective for 
a use for which they have not been approved by 
FDA and that you are not distributing misbranded products in 
violation of the FD&C Act. Please notify this office in 
writing within 15 working days describing the specific steps you 
have taken to address any violations and to prevent their 
recurrence. Include an explanation of each step being taken to 
remedy and prevent the recurrence of any violations, as well 
as copies of related documentation. Failure to adequately address this 
matter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure 
and injunction, without further notice. If you cannot complete corrective 
action within 15 working days, state the reason for the 
delay and the time within which you will complete the 
corrections. This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides 
you with an opportunity to address them. If you believe 
that your products are not in violation of the FD&C 
Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our 
consideration within 15 working days. If you are not located 
in the U.S., please note that products that appear to 
be misbranded or unapproved new drugs may be detained or 
refused admission. We may advise the appropriate regulatory officials in 
the country from which you operate that your products referenced 
above appear to be unapproved and misbranded products that cannot 
be legally sold to consumers in the U.S. Please direct 
your response and any inquiries to FDA at FDAInternetPharmacyTaskForce-CDER@fda.hhs.gov and 
COVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.gov.

80210 United States United States January 5, 2023 WARNING LETTER 



Dear Mr. Matthews: The Center for Tobacco Products of the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions 
to the FDA and our inspection records, and determined that 
Chevaline Investments, LLC d/b/a VaporCore manufactures and distributes e-liquid products 
for commercial distribution in the United States, and that the 
e-liquid products are manufactured and offered for sale or distribution 
to customers in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 
U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they 
are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human 
consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to 
FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1. Therefore, these 
products are required to be in compliance with the requirements 
in the FD&C Act. Please be aware that, effective August 
8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition of 
a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly deemed products, 
to be subject to regulation under the FD&C Act. These 
products include, but are not limited to, electronic nicotine delivery 
systems (including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and pipe tobacco. See 
Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the 
Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the 
Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements 
for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), 
available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. The FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” 
to have a premarket authorization in effect. A “new tobacco 
product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed 
in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or 
any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 
15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 
§ 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required 
for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of 
the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an 
order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco 
product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the 
manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered 
by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by 
FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 387e(j)(3)).New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated 
and Misbranded FDA has determined that you manufacture, sell, and/or 
distribute to customers in the United States Watermelon Machine Gun 
e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order. The tobacco products 
listed above are new tobacco products because they were not 
commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 
2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders 
in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and 
are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, 
these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded 
under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products 
was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the 
FD&C Act. The doing of any act with respect to 
a tobacco product while such article is held for sale 
after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such product 
being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited act under section 
301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, 
to the extent that a report was required under section 
905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure to provide such 
report is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)). Conclusion and Requested Actions 
All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily 
required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to 
enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. Products for which no application 
is pending, including, for example, those with a Marketing Denial 
Order and those for which no application was submitted, are 
among our highest enforcement priorities. For information on how FDA 
intends to prioritize enforcement resources with regard to the marketing 
of certain adulterated and misbranded ENDS and other deemed new 
tobacco products, please refer to the FDA’s guidance titled Enforcement 
Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) and Other Deemed 
Products on the Market Without Premarket Authorization, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market. 
It is your responsibility to ensure that all of your 
tobacco products comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C 
Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations 
of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., 
Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations 
in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead 
to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money 
penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not 
constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the 
FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import 
into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or 
misbranded may be detained or refused admission. The violations discussed 
in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. 
You should take prompt action to address any violations that 
are referenced above, as well as violations that are the 
same as or similar to the ones stated above, and 
take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into 
compliance with the FD&C Act. Please submit a written response 
to this letter within 15 working days from the date 
of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and 
bring your products into compliance, including the dates on which 
you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco 
products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C 
Act. If you believe that your products are not in 
violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any 
supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of 
our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address 
them. You can find the FD&C Act through links on 
FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov. Please note your reference number, ER2200762, 
in your response and direct your response to the following 
address: DEM-WL Response, Office of Compliance and Enforcement FDA Center

(E) Mumbai 400099 Maharashtra India United States Warning Letter 320-23-04 
November 22, 2022 


Dear Mr. Saldanha: The U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your drug manufacturing facility, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals 
Limited, FEI 3004672766 at Plot No. S-7, Colvale Industrial Estate, 
Colvale, Bardez, Goa from May 12, 2022 to May 20, 
2022. This warning letter summarizes significant violations of Current Good 
Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 21 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 
CFR parts 210 and 211). Because your methods, facilities, or 
controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform 
to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning 
of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). We reviewed your June 
12, 2022, response to our Form FDA 483 in detail 
and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence. During our inspection, 
our investigators observed specific violations including, but not limited to, 
the following. 1. Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate any 
unexplained discrepancy or failure of a batch or any of 
its components to meet any of its specifications, whether or 
not the batch has already been distributed (21 CFR 211.192). 
A. Your investigations into rejected batches failed to extend to 
other batches, dosage strengths, and drug products for tablet compression 
machine settings. From 2018 to 2021, you rejected 14 batches 
of 0.1mg and 0.2mg strength desmopressin acetate tablets for out-of-specification 
(OOS) results for (b)(4) and content uniformity results. You implemented 
additional stratified sampling and conducted engineering batches to simulate the 
root cause for the failures for both dosage strengths. Although 
you attributed the content uniformity failure to the lack of 
defined compression parameters for desmopressin acetate 0.1mg batch 20210776, you 
failed to test other batches or drug products that used 
the same (b)(4) process and compression equipment. In your response, 
you acknowledged batches were rejected for the 0.1mg and 0.2mg 
desmopressin acetate tablets and that you did not apply the 
corrective actions for the compression parameters for your 0.2mg strength 
tablets. As a result of this inspection, you conducted a 
retrospective review and discovered a failing stratified sample assay result 
for desmopressin acetate 0.2mg tablets batch 20220121 and initiated a 
voluntary recall of this batch on June 10, 2022. However, 
your response did not adequately address your firm’s failure to 
investigate the assay failure and market impact at the time 
of its occurrence and it did not include an overall 
management strategy for improving all phases of your investigations. In 
response to this letter, provide the following: 2. Your firm 
failed to establish adequate written procedures for production and process 
control designed to assure that the drug products you manufacture 
have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they purport or 
are represented to possess (21 CFR 211.100(a)). Your firm failed 
to adequately validate the manufacturing process for (b)(4) gel (b)(4)%. 
Specifically, your process validation lacks an evaluation of inter-batch and 
intra-batch variability for (b)(4) gel (b)(4)%. Your initial process performance 
qualification for this drug product only tested (b)(4) random tube 
for viscosity taken from tubes collected at the (b)(4) of 
filling for each of the three validation batches. This study 
did not evaluate variability within the batch, and it is 
not described in the validation report where the (b)(4) tube 
was collected. This sampling plan for viscosity does not result 
in statistical confidence in your process performance. A second process 
performance qualification study was conducted to qualify a critical excipient 
used to control the viscosity of the drug product. The 
study included one batch and therefore inter-batch variability could not 
be assessed to ensure the process consistently produces quality drug 
products. You rejected five batches between 2020 and 2021 for 
failure to meet viscosity specifications of (b)(4) gel (b)(4)%. In 
response to this letter, provide the following: 3. Your firm 
failed to establish and follow required laboratory control mechanisms (21 
CFR 211.160(a)). Your firm failed to have appropriate procedures for 
the integration of chromatographic peaks and for the review of 
chromatographic data processing. A. Our investigators identified an example of 
your firm manually entering timed integration events into the processing 
methods and reporting passing results without adequate procedural controls or 
justification. Your analyst manually modified the processing of chromatographic data 
of (b)(4) impurity peak for (b)(4) tablets batch (b)(4). The 
impurity results would not have met release specification if the 
automatic integration processing had been applied in the same manner 
as they were to the standard and other peaks. In 
addition, your chromatographic data integration procedure is inadequate because it 
does not indicate when the analyst can manually input timed 
integration events, how these events should be used, or how 
they should be reviewed. The procedure does not require supervisory 
approval for manually entering timed integration events, a review of 
the original system integrated chromatogram and justification for manually entering 
the timed events. In your response, you reviewed the accuracy 
of integrations performed using the existing chromatographic data processing procedures 
through a retrospective review conducted for a subset of U.S. 
finished drug product batches within shelf life. You identified an 
additional out of specification value of an unspecified impurity for 
(b)(4) and (b)(4) tablets batch (b)(4). The reported result was 
(b)(4)%, while the reprocessed result after removing timed integration events 
identified as “Set Liftoff%” and “Set touchdown%”, was (b)(4)%, which 
is out of specification for unknown impurity (Release Specification of 
No More Than (b)(4)%). You attributed the reprocessed OOS result 
to a noisy baseline in your investigation. However, your investigation 
lacked data to support the conclusion. The investigation report did 
not include the full-scale chromatographic run, information of the integration 
parameters or the chromatograms for the sample standard and blanks. 
These chromatograms were not provided or discussed in your investigation 
report. It is also not discussed in the investigation report 
if system suitability was met to ensure instrumentation readiness in 
the initial processing. Additionally, the minimum area used to disregard 
peaks during initial processing was calculated incorrectly. The minimum area 
response of (b)(4) was applied instead of the correct (b)(4) 
as per your procedure. No additional peaks were found after 
the reprocessing. In addition, your conclusion fails to explain the 
presence of the same peak in your repeat testing and 
did not provide your forced degradation studies. Your response is 
inadequate because you did not commit to performing a retrospective 
review of all chromatographic data associated with the raw materials, 
active pharmaceutical ingredients, and drug product subject to chromatographic testing. 
B. Your calculations for setting the minimum area for peak 
integration of related substances are not recorded or reviewed by 
quality. During the inspection, an analyst was asked to calculate 
the minimum area for (b)(4) tablets batch (b)(4). The minimum 
area which was used during analysis was calculated incorrectly. The 
change in the minimum area did not change the reportable 
result. However, since the calculation is not recorded, the reviewers 
could not detect if the wrong minimum area is calculated 
and used in the analysis. There is a lack of 
assurance the required peaks of interest have been integrated in 
the chromatographic analysis. In your response, you performed a retrospective 
review of a subset of U.S. finished drug product to 
verify the minimum area used in the processing method against 
the actual calculated minimum area. Numerous finished drug product samples 
were identified in which the minimum area used was greater 
than the calculated minimum area. However, no results were observed 
to be out of specification. Your response is inadequate because 
you did not commit to performing a retrospective review of 
all chromatographic data associated with setting the minimum area for 
related substances to include materials such as active pharmaceutical ingredients. 
In response to this letter, provide the following: 4. Your 
firm failed to prepare batch production and control records with 
complete information relating to the production and control of each 
batch of drug product produced (21 CFR 211.188). Your batch 
records were incomplete and did not contain batch specific data 
for compression machine reject limits. Production operators acknowledged using default 
pre-set tablet rejection values in the recipes for tablet compression 
instead of calculating the batch specific rejection limits as required 
by your procedure. There were two investigations where non-conforming tablets 
were found and did not meet the hardness specifications. In 
each of the investigations the impact assessment concluded that since 
the automatic weight control or compaction force control was turned 
on, the risk of finding tablets that did not meet 
specification was low. However, the investigations did not determine if 
the rejection limits were set appropriately. There was a lack 
of assurance to ensure the compression machine was correctly rejecting 
tablets that did not meet specifications. In your response, you 
initiated a study protocol for established compression machine parameters for 
all tablets manufactured at Glenmark. However, your response is inadequate. 
You did not review the programmable logic control (PLC) recipe 
data to ensure the reject limits were properly calculated and 
entered for all U.S. distributed batches within expiration. In response 
to this letter, please provide the following: (b)(4) Conclusion The 
violations cited in this letter are not intended to be 
an all-inclusive list of violations that exist at your facility. 
You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of 
any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence 
of other violations. If you are considering an action that

States December 12, 2022 


Dear Tomohisa Sakurai: During an inspection 
of your firm located in Hachioji-shi, Tokyo, Japan, on September 
6, 2022, through September 9, 2022, an investigator (or investigators) 
from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined 
that your firm manufactures gastrointestinal and surgical endoscopes. Under section 
201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the 
Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because 
they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease 
or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or 
prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any 
function of the body. Our inspection revealed that your firm's 
gastrointestinal and surgical endoscopes are misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of 
the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm 
failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the 
device that is required by or under section 519 of 
the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR Part 
803 - Medical Device Reporting. We received a response from 
your firm, dated September 30, 2022, to the Form FDA 
483 (FDA 483). We address this response below, in relation 
to each of the noted violation(s). These violation(s) include, but 
are not limited to, the following: 1. Failure to submit 
a report to FDA no later than 30 calendar days 
after the day that your firm received or otherwise became 
aware of information, from any source, that reasonably suggests that 
a device that your firm markets has malfunctioned and this 
device or a similar device that it markets would be 
likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious 
injury, if the malfunction were to recur, as required by 
21 CFR 803.50(a)(2). For example, the information in complaint (b)(4) 
(MDR# 8010047-2021-02641), complaint (b)(4) (MDR# 8010047-2021-07387), complaint (b)(4) (MDR# 8010047-2021-11050), 
and complaint (b)(4) (MDR# 8010047-2021-09059), reasonably suggests that your firm’s 
Uretero-Reno Fiberscope and Uretero-Reno Videoscope malfunctioned (e.g., device breakage or 
rupture) while in use. Your firm failed to submit an 
MDR for each of the referenced complaints within the required 
30-calendar day timeframe. As a result of these complaints, your 
firm conducted recall Z-2518-2018, for the Uretero-reno fiberscope URF-P6, where 
it was established that such events could result in potential 
perforation of a patient’s organs. Per 21 CFR 803.3, a 
malfunction is reportable if the manufacturer takes or would be 
required to take an action under sections 518 or 519(g) 
of the Act as a result of the malfunction of 
the device or other similar devices. As such, each of 
the referenced complaints represents an MDR-reportable malfunction, as defined in 
21 CFR 803.3. The adequacy of your firm’s response dated 
September 30, 2022, cannot be determined at this time as 
the response notes that your firm is continuing to implement 
its systemic corrective actions, including optimizing the MDR reporting process 
and staff training. However, the adequacy of your firm’s response 
cannot be determined because your firm’s actions are presently ongoing. 
When your firm’s corrective actions are completed, please provide documentation 
or evidence of the systemic corrective actions, including a copy 
of your revised MDR procedure and a retrospective review of 
complaints for reportability. U.S. federal agencies may take your compliance 
history into account when considering the award of contracts. Please 
notify this office in writing, within fifteen business days from 
the date you receive this letter, of the specific steps 
your firm has taken to correct the noted violation, as 
well as an explanation of how your firm plans to 
prevent the violation, or similar violation, from occurring again. Include 
documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address 
systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm's 
planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please 
include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections 
and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, 
state the reason for the delay and the time within 
which these activities will be completed. Your firm's response should 
be comprehensive and address all violation included in this Warning 
Letter. If you believe that your products are not in 
violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any 
supporting information for our consideration as part of your response. 
Please provide a translation of documentation not in English to 
facilitate our review. We will notify you regarding the adequacy 
of your firm's response(s) and the need to re-inspect your 
firm's facility to verify that the appropriate corrections and/or corrective 
actions have been made. Your firm's response should be sent 
to CDRHWarningLetterResponses@fda.hhs.gov, or if e-mail cannot be used: Food and 
Drug Administration - CDRH/ORP/DRP2 CDRH Regulatory Inspections and Audit Team, 
WO66-1434 10903 New Hampshire Ave. Silver Spring, MD 20993 Refer 
to CMS case # 478315 If you have any questions 
about the contents of this letter, please contact: Mark Antonino 
at Mark.Antonino@fda.hhs.gov Finally, you should know that this letter is 
not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violation 
at your firm's facility. It is your firm's responsibility to 
ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA.

21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d). There is currently a 
global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus 
that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” 
(SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named 
“Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department 
of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of 
a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the 
Operating Divisions of HHS.2 In addition, on March 13, 2020, 
there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in 
response to COVID-19.3 Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to 
protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization 
by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure 
COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell a product 
that is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure 
COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action 
to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products 
for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19. 
Some examples of the claims on your website and social 
media that establish the intended use of your products and 
misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment 
or prevention of COVID-19 include: You should take immediate action 
to address this matter. This letter is not meant to 
be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection 
with your products or operations. It is your responsibility to 
ensure that the products you sell are in compliance with 
the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations. We advise you 
to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and 
promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing 
your products as safe and effective for a COVID-19-related use 
for which they have not been approved by FDA and 
that you do not make claims that misbrand the products 
in violation of the FD&C Act. Within 48 hours, please 
send an email to COVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.gov describing the specific steps you 
have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of 
each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of any 
violations, as well as copies of related documentation. Failure to 
adequately correct any violations may result in legal action, including, 
without limitation, seizure and injunction. FDA is advising consumers not 
to purchase or use certain products that have not been 
approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that are being 
misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the treatment or 
prevention of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to a 
published list on FDA’s website of firms and websites that 
have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or 
distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the FD&C 
Act. This list can be found at http://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-products. Once you 
have taken actions to address the sale of any unapproved 
and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or 
cure of COVID-19, and any appropriate corrective actions have been 
confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be updated 
to indicate that your firm has taken such corrective actions. 
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you 
with an opportunity to address them. If you cannot take 
action to address this matter completely within 48 hours, state 
the reason for the delay and the time within which 
you will do so. If you believe that your products 
are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your 
reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you 
are not located in the United States, please note that 
products that appear to be misbranded or unapproved new drugs 
may be detained or refused admission if they are offered 
for importation into the United States. We may advise the 
appropriate regulatory officials in the country from which you operate 
that FDA considers your product(s) referenced above to be unapproved 
and misbranded products that cannot be legally sold to consumers 
in the United States. Please direct any inquiries to FDA 
at COVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.gov. FTC Cease and Desist Demand: In addition, it 
is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 41 
et seq., to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, 
or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable 
scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating 
that the claims are true at the time they are 
made. For COVID-19, no such study is currently known to 
exist for the product identified above. Thus, any coronavirus-related prevention 
or treatment claims regarding such product are not supported by 
competent and reliable scientific evidence. You must immediately cease and 
desist making all such claims. Violations of the FTC Act 
may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court 
injunction and an order may require that you pay back 
money to consumers. In addition, pursuant to the COVID-19 Consumer 
Protection Act, Section 1401, Division FF, of the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2021, P.L. 116-260, marketers who make deceptive claims about 
the treatment, cure, prevention, or mitigation of COVID-19 are subject 
to a civil penalty of up to $46,517 per violation 
and may be required to pay refunds to consumers or 
provide other relief pursuant to Section 19(b) of the FTC 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 57b(b). Within 48 hours, please send 
an email to Serena Viswanathan, Associate Director of the FTC’s 
Division of Advertising Practices, at sviswanathan@ftc.gov certifying that you have 
ceased making unsubstantiated claims for the product identified above. If 
you have any questions regarding compliance with the FTC Act, 
please contact Ms. Viswanathan at 202-326-3244.

United States United States January 19, 2023WARNING LETTER To Whom 
It May Concern: The Center for Tobacco Products of the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions 
to the FDA and our inspection records, and determined that 
Modfathers Vapor manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for commercial distribution 
in the United States, and that the e-liquid products are 
manufactured and offered for sale or distribution to customers in 
the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), 
these products are tobacco products because they are made or 
derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco 
products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under 
section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) 
and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1. Therefore, these products are required 
to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C 
Act. Please be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA 
deemed additional products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, 
except accessories to these newly deemed products, to be subject 
to regulation under the FD&C Act. These products include, but 
are not limited to, electronic nicotine delivery systems (including e-cigarettes 
and e-liquids), cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming 
Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention 
and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution 
of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 
81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. 
The FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a 
premarket authorization in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any 
tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United 
States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco 
product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 
910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, 
a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new 
tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted 
a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the 
product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) 
of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a 
report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from 
the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 
905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)). New 
Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded 
FDA has determined that you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to 
customers in the United States ACAI DOUGHNUT e-liquid products without 
a marketing authorization order. The tobacco products listed above are 
new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in 
the United States as of February 15, 2007. The products 
do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under 
section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise 
exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are 
adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a 
notice or other information respecting these products was not provided 
as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. The 
doing of any act with respect to a tobacco while 
such article is held for sale after shipment in interstate 
commerce which results in such product being adulterated or misbranded 
is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, to the extent that 
a report was required under section 905(j) of the FD&C 
Act, the failure to provide such report is a prohibited 
act under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 331(p)). Conclusion and Requested Actions All new tobacco products 
on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are 
marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s 
discretion. Products for which no application is pending, including, for 
example, those with a Marketing Denial Order and those for 
which no application was submitted, are among our highest enforcement 
priorities. For information on how FDA intends to prioritize enforcement 
resources with regard to the marketing of certain adulterated and 
misbranded ENDS and other deemed new tobacco products, please refer 
to the FDA’s guidance titled Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine 
Delivery Systems (ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the Market 
Without Premarket Authorization, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market. It is your responsibility 
to ensure that all of your tobacco products comply with 
each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing 
regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 
21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to 
tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 
1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, 
but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. 
However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for 
purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note 
that tobacco products offered for import into the United States 
that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained 
or refused admission. The violations discussed in this letter do 
not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt 
action to address any violations that are referenced above, as 
well as violations that are the same as or similar 
to the ones stated above, and take any necessary actions 
to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C 
Act. Please submit a written response to this letter within 
15 working days from the date of receipt describing your 
actions to address any violations and bring your products into 
compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative 
sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan 
for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe 
that your products are not in violation of the FD&C 
Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our 
consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides 
you with an opportunity to address them. You can find

Dear Mr. Tilley: The Center for Tobacco Products of 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your 
submissions to the FDA and our inspection records, and determined 
that Southbound Vapes manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for commercial 
distribution in the United States, and that the e-liquid products 
are manufactured and offered for sale or distribution to customers 
in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 
321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made 
or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain

(May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. The FD&C Act requires 
“new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization in effect. 
A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was

marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C

under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1)

905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and 
FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to

equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing 
Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded FDA has determined that you 
manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to customers in the United States 
Berry Blast e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order. The 
tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they 
were not commercially marketed in the United States as of 
February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing 
authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C 
Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization 
requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they 
are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting 
these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) 
of the FD&C Act. The doing of any act with 
respect to a tobacco product while such article is held 
for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results in 
such product being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited act 
under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
331(k)). Additionally, to the extent that a report was required 
under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure to 
provide such report is a prohibited act under section 301(p) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)). Conclusion and

United States United States DATE: 11/18/2022 Case #: 642792 WARNING 
LETTER 


Dear Mr. Graves, From March 1, 2022, to March 
10, 2022, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigator 
inspected your facility, North American Custom Laboratories, LLC dba FarmaKeio 
Superior Custom Compounding, located at 1736 North Greenville Avenue, Richardson, 
TX 75081. During the inspection, the investigator noted serious deficiencies 
in your practices for producing drug products intended or expected 
to be sterile, which put patients at risk. FDA issued 
a Form FDA 483 to your firm on March 10, 
2022. FDA acknowledges receipt of your facility’s response, dated March 
30, 2022, as well as your subsequent correspondence. FDA acknowledges 
that your firm initiated a voluntary recall of drug products 
that are intended to be sterile on April 5, 2022. 
Based on this inspection, it appears that you produced drug 
products that violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(FDCA). A. Compounded Drug Products Under the FDCA Section 503A 
of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 353a] describes the conditions 
under which human drug products compounded by a licensed pharmacist 
in a State licensed pharmacy or a Federal facility, or 
a licensed physician, qualify for exemptions from three sections of 
the FDCA: compliance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) (section 
501(a)(2)(B)); labeling with adequate directions for use (section 502(f)(1)); and 
FDA approval prior to marketing (section 505) [21 U.S.C. §§ 
351(a)(2)(B), 352(f)(1) and 355(a)].1B. Violations of the FDCA Adulterated Drug 
Products The FDA investigator noted that drug products were prepared, 
packed, or held under insanitary conditions, whereby they may have 
become contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health, causing 
your drug products to be adulterated under section 501(a)(2)(A) of 
the FDCA. For example, the investigator observed that: 1. Your 
firm used a (b)(4) for the purposes of product sterilization 
that was not appropriate for pharmaceutical use and the (b)(4) 
testing was inadequate. Therefore, you do not have assurance that 
the (b)(4) was integral throughout use. 2. Your firm did 
not adequately disinfect materials or supplies during transfer from the 
ISO 8 cleanroom into higher classification areas. 3. Your firm 
handled hazardous drug products without providing adequate containment, segregation, or 
cleaning of work surfaces and utensils to prevent cross-contamination. 4. 
Your firm failed to perform adequate smoke studies under dynamic 
conditions to demonstrate unidirectional airflow within the ISO 5 area. 
Therefore, your products intended to be sterile are produced in 
an environment that may not provide adequate protection against the 
risk of contamination. 5. Your media fills were not performed 
under the most challenging or stressful conditions. Therefore, there is 
a lack of assurance that your firm can aseptically produce 
drug products within your facility. Under section 301(a) of the 
FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)], the introduction or delivery for 
introduction into interstate commerce of any drug that is adulterated 
is a prohibited act. Further, it is a prohibited act 
under section 301(k) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 331(k)] 
to do any act with respect to a drug, if 
such act is done while the drug is held for 
sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the 
drug being adulterated. C. Corrective Actions We have reviewed your 
firm’s response to the Form FDA 483. Regarding your response 
related to the insanitary conditions, some of your corrective actions 
appear adequate; however, we cannot fully evaluate the adequacy of 
the following corrective actions described in your response because you 
did not include sufficient information or supporting documentation: 1. In 
your response to Observation 1 of the Form FDA 483, 
we acknowledge your firm’s statement that you have regained supply 
of and resumed use of previously unavailable (b)(4) for “immediate 
use sterile subcutaneous injectable compounding” at your facility. However, you 
did not provide sufficient evidence of the corrective actions, such 
as purchase orders, current batch records (i.e., formula work sheets), 
or (b)(4) testing procedures for the newly acquired (b)(4). 2. 
Regarding the pink residue on the ceiling, vents, and walls 
in your production area as described in Observation 5 of 
the Form FDA 483, you provided your revised SOP, 02-CPCP-12 
Non-Sterile Hazardous Compound – Hormone Only and committed to “attempting 
a deep scrubbing of the room.” It is unclear if 
this cleaning was attempted and/or effective to remediate this observation 
or if your revised procedures have prevented reoccurrence. 3. In 
your response to Observation 7 of the Form FDA 483, 
we acknowledge your firm’s statement that, “Moving forward, when smoke 
studies are conducted, footage from video will record, in detail, 
the dynamic compounding of sterile compounding in a PEC.” However, 
we cannot fully evaluate your response as you did not 
provide sufficient supporting documentation, such as an updated smoke study 
protocol or an updated detailed report, and/or video. 4. In 
your response to Observation 8 of the Form FDA 483, 
we acknowledge your firm’s statement that, “(b)(4).” However, we cannot 
fully evaluate your response as you did not provide sufficient 
supporting documentation, such updated media fill protocol or results. In 
addition, from review of the evidence collected during the inspection, 
your October 26, 2021, Environmental Monitoring Report lists your action 
level for the ISO 5 area as (b)(4) cfu/m3 for 
“Air Test” and (b)(4) cfu/plate for “Surface Test.” Please note 
that any microbial contamination in the ISO 5 area is 
a serious concern and considered an insanitary condition. If any 
ISO 5 recovery occurs, your firm should immediately assess the 
impact on drug products produced. This assessment should include a 
thorough evaluation of how contamination could have entered this critical 
area, and over what period of time the contamination could 
have existed, as well as drug products that remain on 
the market that could have been affected. Please be aware 
that section 501(a)(2)(A) of the FDCA concerning insanitary conditions applies 
regardless of whether drug products you compound meet the conditions 
of section 503A. FDA strongly recommends that your management undertake 
a comprehensive assessment of operations, including facility design, procedures, personnel, 
processes, maintenance, materials, and systems. In particular, this review should 
assess your aseptic processing operations. A third-party consultant with relevant 
sterile drug processing expertise should assist you in conducting this 
comprehensive evaluation. D. Conclusion The violations cited in this letter 
are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations 
at your facility. You are responsible for investigating and determining 
the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence 
or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility 
to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of 
federal law, including FDA regulations. You should take prompt action 
to address any violations. Failure to adequately address any violations 
may result in legal action without further notice, including, without 
limitation, seizure and injunction. Within fifteen (15) working days of 
receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing 
of the specific steps that you have taken to address 
any violations. Please include an explanation of each step being 
taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as 
copies of related documentation. This letter notifies you of our 
concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. If 
you believe your products are not in violation of the 
FDCA, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our 
consideration. If you cannot completely address this matter within fifteen 
(15) working days, state the reason for the delay and 
the time in which you will do so. Your written 
notification should refer to case number 642792. Please electronically submit 
your reply, on company letterhead, to Shawn Larson, Compliance Officer, 
at ORAPHARM2_RESPONSES@fda.hhs.gov and Shawn.Larson@fda.hhs.gov If you have questions regarding the

States United States January 10, 2023 WARNING LETTER 


Dear Kyle 
Ezzio: The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed the website https://lineagevapors.square.site and 
determined that the e-liquid products listed there are manufactured and 
offered for sale or distribution to customers in the United 
States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products 
are tobacco products because they are made or derived from 
tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including 
e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 
C.F.R. § 1100.1. Therefore, e-liquid products are required to be 
in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act. Please 
be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional 
products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories 
to these newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation 
under the FD&C Act. These products include, but are not 
limited to, ENDS (including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and pipe 
tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject 
to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended 
by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions 
on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required 
Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 
10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. Generally, to be legally marketed 
in the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco 
products” to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A 
“new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not 
commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 
2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed 
after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 
21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under 
section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) 
is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the 
manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA 
issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a 
predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or 
(2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications 
are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence 
granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)). New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing 
Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded Our review of the website 
https://lineagevapors.square.site revealed that you manufacture and offer for sale or 
distribution to customers in the United States e-liquid products without 
a marketing authorization order including Melon Strapple, Surreal Cereal, and 
Son of Peach. The e-liquid products listed above are new 
tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the 
United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do 
not have an FDA marketing authorization order in effect under 
section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise 
exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are 
adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act. In addition, 
these products are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C 
Act because a notice or other information respecting these products 
was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the 
FD&C Act. Conclusion and Requested Actions FDA has not received 
an application from your firm requesting marketing authorization for the 
products listed in this Warning Letter. These products and any 
other new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily 
required premarket authorization are adulterated and misbranded and are subject 
to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. The violations discussed in 
this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You 
should address any violations that are referenced above, as well 
as violations that are the same as or similar to 
those stated above, and promptly take any necessary actions to 
bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act. 
It is your responsibility to ensure that all of your 
tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this 
website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or 
search engine websites), in any other media in which you 
advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable 
provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure 
to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
§ 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products 
including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, 
and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not 
limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this 
Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of 
section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco 
products offered for import into the United States that appear 
to be adulterated or misbranded may be detained or refused 
admission. Please submit a written response to this letter within 
15 working days from the date of receipt describing your 
actions to address any violations and bring your products into 
compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative 
labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and 
your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If 
you believe that your products are not in violation of 
the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information 
for our consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings 
and provides you with an opportunity to address them. You 
can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s homepage

FDA Ref. No.: 23-HFD-45-01-01 


Dear Dr. Marzban: This Warning Letter 
informs you of objectionable conditions observed during the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection conducted between November 12 and 
November 19, 2021, of the Larkin Community Hospital Institutional Review 
Board (IRB). Investigator Richard A. Lyght, representing FDA, conducted the 
inspection to determine whether the IRB’s procedures for the protection 
of human subjects complied with FDA regulations contained in Title 
21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 50 
and 56. These regulations apply to clinical investi-gations of products 
regulated by FDA. This inspection is a part of FDA’s 
Bioresearch Monitoring Program, which includes inspections designed to evaluate the 
conduct of research and to help ensure that the rights, 
safety, and welfare of human subjects have been protected. At 
the conclusion of the inspection, Investigator Lyght presented and discussed 
with you Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations. We acknowledge receipt 
of the IRB’s December 6, 2021, written response to the 
Form FDA 483. From our review of the FDA Establishment 
Inspection Report, the documents submitted with that report, and the 
IRB’s December 6, 2021, written response, it appears that the 
IRB did not adhere to applicable statutory requirements in the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and FDA 
regulations governing the protection of human subjects. We wish to 
emphasize the following:1. The IRB failed to review proposed research 
at convened meetings at which a majority of the members 
of the IRB are present, including at least one member 
whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas [21 CFR 56.108(c)]. 
Under 21 CFR 56.108(c), except when an expedited review procedure 
is used, the IRB may review proposed research only at 
convened meetings at which a majority of the IRB members 
are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns 
are in nonscientific areas. The IRB failed to adhere to 
this requirement. Specifically, the IRB reviewed and approved FDA-regulated research 
at convened IRB meetings where a majority of the IRB 
members, including at least one nonscientist member, were not present. 
IRB meeting minutes for meetings held on April 24, 2020; 
August 3, 2020; September 11, 2020; November 16, 2020; and 
February 15, 2021, indicate that the following members were present, 
and that no member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific 
areas attended: The IRB should not have reviewed or approved 
the proposed research because the IRB did not have a 
member present whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas at 
these IRB meetings in which FDA-regulated research was reviewed. During 
the inspection, the IRB chair, Gerardo F. Ferrer, M.D., indicated 
that (b)(6) acted as the nonscientific IRB member. However, Ms. 
(b)(6) resigned on April 24, 2020, and was not in 
attendance at any of the above-mentioned IRB meetings. Furthermore, no 
other nonscientific member appears to have been identified or attended 
any of the above-mentioned IRB meetings. In your December 6, 
2021, written response to the Form FDA 483, you indicated 
that this observation has been noted and procedures are being 
initiated to correct this observation. In addition, you indicated that 
IRB meetings will only take place if a majority of 
the IRB members are available, including one nonscientific member. You 
also stated that the IRB minute agendas will document members’ 
affiliations to facilitate audit review designation. We are unable to 
perform an informed evaluation of the IRB’s written response because 
you did not provide a corrective action plan that, if 
properly carried out, would prevent the recurrence of this type 
of violation in the future. Specifically, you did not provide 
sufficient details on the procedures you are initiating and how 
you will ensure that a majority of the IRB members, 
including at least one member whose primary concerns are in 
nonscientific areas, will be present at convened meetings when proposed 
FDA-regulated research is under review. As an IRB, review of 
proposed research at convened meetings at which a majority of 
the IRB members is present, including at least one member 
whose primary concerns are in a nonscientific area, is important 
to ensure that the IRB’s review and approval of research 
is fair and equitable. 2. The IRB failed to prepare 
and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities, including a list 
of IRB members [21 CFR 56.115(a)(5)]. Under 21 CFR 56.115(a), 
the IRB is required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation 
of IRB activities, including a list of IRB members identified 
by name; earned degrees; representative capacity; indications of experience such 
as board certifications, licenses, etc., sufficient to describe each member’s 
chief anticipated contributions to IRB deliberations; and any employment or 
other relationship between each member and the institution. The IRB 
failed to adhere to these requirements. Specifically, the IRB failed 
to prepare and maintain a list of IRB members, in 
accordance with 21 CFR 56.115(a)(5), for the time period between 
July 2019 and March 2021. During the inspection, the IRB 
compiled a membership list for this time frame. However, this 
list is inadequate because it did not include all IRB 
members listed in minutes for IRB meetings convened during this 
time frame. Furthermore, for several listed IRB members, the list 
did not include each IRB member’s representative capacity, indications of 
experience sufficient to describe the member’s chief anticipated contributions to 
the IRB deliberations, or any employment or other relationship between 
the member and the institution. For example: In your December 
6, 2021, written response to the Form FDA 483, you 
noted the observation and stated that it was difficult to 
acquire in full details the complete membership list because the 
prior IRB coordinator’s files were not easily accessible. You noted 
that a new roster of current members will be created, 
maintained, monitored annually, and adjusted when required. You also indicated 
that the membership list will include the full details of 
each member’s name, earned degrees, representative capacity, and indication of 
experience sufficient to describe the member’s chief anticipated contribution to 
IRB deliberations. However, we note that this membership list, as 
proposed, would not meet the regulatory requirements unless employment or 
other relationship between each member and the institution were to 
be included, as required under 21 CFR 56.115(a)(5). We are 
unable to undertake an informed evaluation of the IRB’s written 
response because you did not provide a corrective action plan 
that, if properly carried out, would prevent the recurrence of 
this type of violation in the future. Specifically, you did 
not provide sufficient details on the actions that will be 
taken (for example, maintaining and monitoring the new membership list 
annually) to ensure that the IRB prepares and maintains a 
list of IRB members in accordance with the regulations at 
21 CFR 56.115(a)(5). In addition, you did not provide documentation 
of a complete, updated membership list that includes the missing 
information described above. Please submit a current membership list that 
complies with 21 CFR 56.115(a)(5). As an IRB, you are 
required to prepare and maintain a complete list of IRB 
members in compliance with 21 CFR 56.115(a)(5) to ensure that 
the IRB has adequate representation, experience, and expertise to promote 
complete and adequate review of the institution’s research activities. 3. 
The IRB failed to ensure that information given to subjects 
as part of informed consent is in accordance with 21 
CFR part 50.25 [21 CFR 56.109(b)]. Under 21 CFR 56.109(b), 
the IRB must require that information given to subjects as 
part of the informed consent process is in accordance with 
21 CFR 50.25 (elements of informed consent). The IRB failed 
to ensure that the IRB-approved informed consent documents (ICDs) for 
the following two clinical trials, which meet the definition of 
an “applicable drug clinical trial”1, contained the statement2 notifying the 
subject that clinical trial information has been or will be 
submitted for inclusion in the clinical trial registry databank, as 
required by 21 CFR 50.25(c): In your December 6, 2021, 
written response, you noted the observation and stated that actions 
were in motion to establish best practices. You also indicated 
that the formatted informed consent will contain the statement for 
clinical trials, as required by 21 CFR 50.25(c). We acknowledge 
your written response, indicating that “actions are in motion to 
establish best practice” and that ICDs will contain the required 
information. However, we are unable to perform an informed evaluation 
of the IRB’s written response because you did not provide 
a corrective action plan that, if properly carried out, would 
prevent the recurrence of this type of violation in the 
future. Specifically, you did not provide sufficient details on the 
best practices you are establishing and how you will ensure 
that the ICDs will contain the statement, as required by 
21 CFR 50.25(c), when appropriate. Failure to ensure that IRB-approved 
informed consent documents for applicable clinical trials contain the statement 
notifying subjects that clinical trial information has been or will 
be submitted for inclusion in the clinical trial registry databank 
may result in subjects not being provided appropriate human subject 
research protections or pertinent information about the clinical investigation. For 
more information on this element, please see “Guidance for Sponsors, 
Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards: Questions and Answers on Informed 
Consent Elements, 21 CFR § 50.25(c)” at the following URL: 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM291085.pdf. This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive 
list of deficiencies related to the IRB’s procedures or the 
review and approval by the IRB of protocols and informed 
consent documents. It is the IRB’s responsibility to ensure adherence 
to each requirement of the law and relevant FDA regulations. 
This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you 
an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. Within 15 business 
days of your receipt of this letter, you should notify 
this office in writing of the actions the IRB plans 
to take or has taken to address any violations and 
to prevent recurrence of similar violations in the future. Failure 
to adequately address this matter may lead to regulatory action. 
If you believe you have complied with the FD&C Act 
and relevant regulations, please include your reasoning and any supporting 
information for our consideration. We recommend that the IRB visit 
the following FDA Web page for information on human subject 
protections that may assist the IRB in its efforts to 
come into compliance with FDA regulations: http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/default.htm. If the IRB 
has any questions, please call Miah Jung, Pharm.D., M.S., at 
240-402-3728. Alternatively, you may e-mail FDA at CDER-OSI-Communications@fda.hhs.gov. The IRB’s

United States United States WARNING LETTERWL 624797 November 16, 2022 



Dear Mr. Vizcarrondo: This is to advise you that the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of 
your facility, located at 1460 W. 135th St., Gardena, CA 
from November 2, 2021, through November 10, 2021. During the 
inspection, our investigators collected labeling for your “Yerbas Finas Leche 
de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” dietary supplement. Based on 
our subsequent review of the product labeling, we have concluded 
that this product is in violation of section 403 of 
the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and 
the regulations contained within Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, 
Part 101 (21 CFR Part 101). FDA received your response 
to FDA’s Form 483, Inspectional Observations, on February 4, 2022. 
You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links 
on the FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov. Misbranded Dietary Supplements 
1. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y 
Omega-3” product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(a)(1) 
of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)] because its labeling is 
false or misleading. Specifically: a) Our sampling analysis of your 
“Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” dietary 
supplement (b)(4) independent determinations of potassium. Magnesium and potassium are 
Class II minerals as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(3). Because 
your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” 
dietary supplement does not contain levels of magnesium or potassium 
at least equal to 80 percent of the value declared 
on the label for each nutrient, as required by 21 
CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii), the product’s label is false or misleading. 2. 
Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” 
is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(1)(A) of the 
Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(1)(A)] because the product label bears 
nutrient content claims but does not meet the requirements to 
bear such claims. Under sections 403(r)(1)(A) and (2)(A)(i) of the 
Act, a claim that characterizes the level of a nutrient 
which is of the type required to be in the 
labeling of the food must be made in accordance with 
a regulation authorizing the use of such a claim. Under 
21 CFR 101.13(b), a claim that expressly or implicitly characterizes 
the level of a nutrient of the type required to 
be in nutrition labeling under 21 CFR 101.9 or under 
21 CFR 101.36 (that is, a nutrient content claim) may 
not be made on the label or in labeling of 
foods unless the claim is made in accordance with 21 
CFR 101.13 and with the applicable regulations in 21 CFR 
Part 101 subpart D or in Part 105 or Part 
107. An implied nutrient content claim includes any claim that 
describes the food or an ingredient therein in a manner 
that suggests that a nutrient is absent or present in 
a certain amount (21 CFR 101.13(b)(2)(i)). Characterizing the level of 
a nutrient in the food labeling of a product without 
complying with the specific requirements pertaining to nutrient content claims 
for that nutrient misbrands the product under section 403(r)(1)(A) of 
the Act. Specifically, a) Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste 
con Guanabana y Omega-3” product label displays the following claim 
“Canary Seed … is high in protein content.” In the 
context of this label, FDA considers the claim “Canary Seed 
. . . is high in protein content” to be 
an implied claim about the food itself. In accordance with 
21 CFR 101.54(b), the terms “high,” “rich in,” or “excellent 
source of” may be used to characterize the level of 
a nutrient on the label and in the labeling of 
foods provided that the food contains 20 percent or more 
of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) or the Daily Reference 
Value (DRV) per reference amount customarily consumed (RACC). The DRV 
for protein is 50 grams (g), and the RACC for 
your product is 2 Tablespoons. According to the Supplement Facts 
label, your product contains 2.6 g of protein per 2 
Tablespoons, which is only 5% of the DRV (rounded to 
the nearest whole percent). We also note that elsewhere on 
the Supplement Facts label indicates that protein per 2 Tablespoons 
is 12% with no clear indication as to what the 
percentage relates. b) Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con 
Guanabana y Omega-3” product label displays the following claim “Canary 
seed … It contains as much protein as meat …” 
In the context of this label, FDA considers this claim 
about canary seed, an ingredient in the food, to be 
an implied claim about the food itself. In accordance with 
21 CFR 101.65(c)(2), the phrases “contains the same amount of 
[nutrient] as a [food]” and “as much [nutrient] as a 
[food]” may be used on the label or in the 
labeling of foods, provided that the amount of the nutrient 
in the reference food is enough to qualify that food 
as a “good source” of that nutrient, and the labeled 
food, on a per serving basis, is an equivalent, good 
source of that nutrient (e.g., “as much fiber as an 
apple,” “Contains the same amount of Vitamin C as an 
8 oz. glass of orange juice.”). Under 21 CFR 101.54(c), 
the term “good source” may be used to characterize the 
level of a nutrient on the label and in the 
labeling of foods provided that the food contains 10 to 
19 percent of the RDI or the DRV per RACC. 
As stated previously, the Supplement Facts label declares 2.6 g 
of protein per 2 Tablespoons of the product, which is 
only 5% of the DRV for protein; 5% protein is 
not within 10 to 19% of the DRV for protein 
and, therefore, your product does not qualify to be “an 
equivalent, good source.” 3. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste 
con Guanabana y Omega-3” product is misbranded within the meaning 
of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] 
in that the presentation of the nutritional information on the 
labeling of your product does not comply with 21 CFR 
101.36. For example: a) The product label declares “Proprietary Blend 
… 610g”, that being the total net contents of the 
product. The use of “Proprietary Blend” with its quantitative amount 
is permitted in the Supplement Facts label but relative to 
the serving size. Furthermore, any “Proprietary Blend” declaration with its 
quantitative amount must be in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(iii)(c). 
b) The label fails to declare dietary ingredients by the 
correct name and in the correct order and format, per 
21 CFR 101.36. c) The declaration of calories is not 
in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and 101.9(c)(1) in that 
the caloric content per serving is not expressed to the 
nearest 5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories. Furthermore, 
the declaration does not appear to correlate with the declared 
quantitative amounts for the listed macronutrients. d) The label fails 
to declare the quantitative amount by weight per serving of 
each dietary ingredient either in a separate column aligned to 
the right of the column of names or immediately following 
the listing of names within the same column. When information 
on the percent of Daily Values is listed, this information 
must be presented in one column aligned under the heading 
of ""% Daily Value"" and to the right of the 
column of amounts. The headings ""% Daily Value (DV),"" ""% 
DV,"" ""Percent Daily Value,"" or ""Percent DV"" may be substituted 
for ""% Daily Value."" The heading ""% Daily Value"" must 
be placed on the same line as the heading ""Amount 
Per Serving."" [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(A)] e) Each quantitative amount declared 
for the carbohydrates, protein, and fat fail to use the 
level of significance given in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), in accordance 
with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B). f) The label fails to include 
a heavy bar under “Servings per Container, as required by 
21 CFR 101.36(e)(6). g) The label fails to list (b)(2)-dietary 
ingredients in the correct order, as required by 21 CFR 
101.36(b)(2)(i). h) The title and all headings are not bolded 
to distinguish them from the other information, as required by 
21 CFR 101.36(e)(1). i) The label declares 0% for Vitamin 
A, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, and cholesterol. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient 
not present, or in amounts that can be declared as 
zero in 101.9(c), shall not be declared (e.g., amounts corresponding 
to less than 2 percent of the RDI for vitamins 
and minerals) in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i). j) The 
declared % Daily Values for protein and carbohydrate do not 
correlate with the quantitative amounts declared for each macronutrient. k) 
The label declares “*Percent of daily value are based on 
a 2,000 calorie diet. Your daily value may be higher 
or lower depending on your calorie needs. Daily value has 
not been established.” There is no provision in the regulation 
for the “Your daily value may be higher or lower 
depending on your calorie needs.” in the Supplement Facts label. 
Other dietary ingredients (also known as (b)(3)-dietary ingredients) must bear 
a symbol (different than the symbol used for the 2,000 
calorie diet statement) under the heading of the % Daily 
Value that refers to the same symbol placed at the 
bottom of the nutrition label and followed by the statement 
“Daily Value not established.” 4. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de 
Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product is misbranded within the 
meaning of section 403(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 
343(f)] because the product label contains information in two languages 
but does not repeat all of the required information in 
both languages. As required by 21 CFR 101.15(c), if a 
product label contains any representation in a foreign language, all 
words, statements, and other information required by or under authority 
of the Act to appear on the label must appear 
in the foreign language. The product includes foreign language on 
the label but fails to declare the product name, all 
information in the Supplements Facts label, and the name and 
address of the responsible party in both languages. 5. Your 
“Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product 
is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the 
Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared 
on the label is incomplete. Specifically, the product’s label fails 
to declare the equivalent metric quantity in parenthesis (fluids in 
milliliters and all other foods in grams) following the common 
household measure, as required by 21 CFR 101.9(b)(7). 6. Your 
“Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product 
is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the 
Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to 
identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from 
which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, 
as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). 7. Your “Yerbas Finas 
Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product is misbranded 
within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 
U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the label fails to declare 
the common or usual name of each ingredient used as 
required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4(a) and 
(h). For example, the product’s batch product record indicates “canary 
seed (Phalaris canariensis).” The standardized common name for Phalaris canariensis 
is “canary grass”, as noted in Herbs of Commerce. Furthermore, 
the Supplement Facts label lists “guanabana” which is not a 
standardized common name listed in the reference Herbs of Commerce; 
soursop is the standardized common name for guanabana.” In addition, 
the batch record indicates “guanabana leaf powder”. 8. Your “Yerbas 
Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product is 
misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(r)(6) of the Act 
[21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(6)] because the labeling makes structure/function claims 
but fails to bear the required dietary supplement disclaimer in 
accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(b) and (c). Under section 403(r)(6) 
of the Act, a dietary supplement may bear certain claims, 
generally called ""structure/function claims,"" on its label or in its 
labeling provided that the firm has substantiation that the claim 
is truthful and not misleading; the firm has notified FDA 
within 30 days of marketing the product bearing the claim; 
and the claim includes the mandatory disclaimer. This letter is 
not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that 
may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible 
for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and 
for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. 
It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies 
with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations. This 
letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an 
opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter 
may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and 
injunction. We also offer the following comments: 1. Your “Yerbas 
Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product label’s 
dietary supplement statement of identity is not presented in bold 
type on the principal display panel and in a size 
reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on the 
principal display panel. (see 21 CFR 101.3(d)) 2. Your “Yerbas 
Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product label 
is not based upon the revised nutrition labeling regulation which 
became effective July 26, 2016. Labels were to comply with 
the revised labeling regulation by January 1, 2020, or January 
1, 2021, depending upon the annual food sales of the 
manufacturer. When making revisions to your product label, you must 
comply with the current regulations. (see 21 CFR 101.9, 101.30, 
and 101.36) 3. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con 
Guanabana y Omega-3” product label declares Vitamin C at a 
level of 214% Daily Value (DV) per serving; however, a 
review of the batch production record, packing slip and certificate 
of analysis for this product does not appear to indicate 
that the product contains ingredient(s) that would provide Vitamin C 
at a level of 214% DV per serving. Please notify 
FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of 
this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to 
address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being 
taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as 
copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions 
within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay 
and the time within which you will do so. If 
you believe that your products are not in violation of 
the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for 
our consideration. Your written response should be directed to: Sergio

639545 


Dear Joyce Dales: This letter is to advise you 
that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has 
reviewed your product labeling, including on your website at the 
Internet address https://buzzagogo.com/, in August 2022 and has determined that 
you take orders there for the product “Allergy Bee Gone 
for Kids.” The claims on your labeling establish that “Allergy 
Bee Gone for Kids” is an unapproved new drug under 
section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355. In addition, FDA laboratory analysis 
determined that a sample of your “Allergy Bee Gone for 
Kids” product was contaminated with bacillus sp., including B. cereus, 
B. amyloliquefaciens, B. atrophaeus, and others. This contamination is particularly 
concerning because “Allergy Bee Gone for Kids” is a nasal 
swab product and directed for use in young children. The 
results of the FDA laboratory testing of a batch of 
Allergy Bee Gone For Kids Nasal Swab Remedy demonstrate that 
this drug product is adulterated within the meaning of section 
501(a)(1) of the FD&C Act , 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(1), in 
that it consists in whole or in part of any 
filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance. Introducing or delivering this product 
for introduction into interstate commerce violates section 301 of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331. Unapproved New Drugs Examples of 
claims on your labeling that provide evidence of the intended 
uses of your “Allergy Bee Gone for Kids” product include, 
but may not be limited to, the following: From the 
Allergy Bee Gone for Kids label and product page https://buzzagogo.com/collections/allergy-remedies/products/allergy-bee-gone-for-kids: 
From your product page https://buzzagogo.com/collections/allergy-remedies/products/allergy-bee-gone-for-kids: The above claims for “Allergy 
Bee Gone for Kids,” which is labeled as homeopathic, demonstrate 
that it is a drug under section 201(g)(1) of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because it is intended for 
use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of 
disease and/or intended to affect the structure or function of 
the body. Moreover, this product is also a “new drug,” 
as defined by section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 
U.S.C. 321(p), because it is not generally recognized as safe 
and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or 
suggested in its labeling. With certain exceptions not applicable here, 
new drugs may not be introduced or delivered for introduction 
into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in 
effect, as described in sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). No FDA-approved application 
pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
355, is in effect for this product. Accordingly, this product 
is an unapproved new drug marketed in violation of sections 
301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) 
and 355(a). We note that “Allergy Bee Gone for Kids” 
is labeled as a homeopathic drug with active ingredients measured 
in homeopathic strengths. Under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 
21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), the term “drug” includes articles recognized in 
the official Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States (HPUS), or 
any supplement to it. Homeopathic drug products are subject to 
the same statutory requirements as other drugs; nothing in the 
FD&C Act exempts homeopathic drugs from any of the requirements 
related to adulteration, misbranding, or approval. Adulteration Violations FDA laboratory 
testing of a batch of Allergy Bee Gone For Kids 
Nasal Swab Remedy drug product (lot 2006491) found that it 
contained objectionable microbial contamination. The individual sample results from the 
tested batch spanned between 50 and 770 colony forming units 
(CFU)/mL for total aerobic microbial count, and between 5 and 
70 CFU/mL for total yeast and mold counts. Therefore, this 
homeopathic drug product is adulterated under section 501(a)(1) of the 
FD&C Act, in that it consists in whole or in 
part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance. Microorganisms identified 
included Bacillus cereus, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus atrophaeus and others. Bacillus 
cereus produces a toxin and is pathogenic to humans. The 
labeling on your product indicates it may be used for 
children as young as 1 year old. The high bioburden 
and presence of objectionable microorganisms in conjunction with the route 
of administration poses a high risk of harm to patients, 
including children. During the FDA teleconference on May 24, 2022, 
you stated that your drug products are manufactured by a 
contract manufacturer and that your drug products are tested before 
release by your contract manufacturer. During the call, you agreed 
to conduct a voluntary recall of the lot currently in 
U.S. distribution. On June 7, 2022, you conducted a voluntary 
recall of lot 2006491 of Allergy Bee Gone For Kids 
Nasal Swab Remedy to the consumer level due to potential 
microbial contamination, as noted on the following FDA website:https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/buzzagogo-inc-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-allergy-bee-gone-kids-nasal-swab-remedy-due In 
response to this letter, provide: Use of Contract Manufacturers Drugs 
must be manufactured in conformance with CGMP. FDA is aware 
that many drug manufacturers use independent contractors such as production 
facilities, testing laboratories, packagers, and labelers. FDA regards contractors as 
extensions of the manufacturer. You are responsible for the quality 
of your drugs regardless of agreements in place with your 
contract facilities. You are required to ensure that drugs are 
made in accordance with section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act. 
For additional information regarding contract manufacturing, you may refer to 
FDA’s guidance document Contract Manufacturing Arrangements for Drugs: Quality Agreements 
at https://www.fda.gov/media/86193/download. Conclusion This letter is not intended to be 
an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection 
with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining 
the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence 
or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility 
to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of 
federal law, including FDA regulations. This letter notifies you of 
our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. 
Failure to adequately address any violations may result in legal

in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this 
letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address 
any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken 
to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies 
of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within 
fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and 
the time within which you will do so. If you 
believe that your products are not in violation of the 
FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for 
our consideration. Your response should be sent to U.S. Food

NY 10701 United States United States WARNING LETTER Re: CMS 
# 633364 


Dear Mr. Noe Ramirez: On April 5 through 
19, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a 
Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of Leimax, Corp. located 
at 179 Saw Mill River Rd #B, Yonkers, NY 10701. 
We also conducted inspections on June 18, 2018 and March 
4, 2020. These inspections were conducted to determine compliance with 
the requirements of section 805 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the 
implementing FSVP regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L. 
The FSVP regulation requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities 
to verify that human and/or animal food they import into 
the United States has been produced in a manner that 
meets applicable U.S. food safety standards. You may find information 
relating to the FSVP regulation and your responsibilities to comply 
with the regulation through links in FDA’s FSVP web page 
at: https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals. During the most recent inspection, we found that 
you are not in compliance with the requirements of 21 
CFR part 1, subpart L for the foods you import. 
Because of this significant violation, you are not in compliance 
with section 805 of the FD&C Act. At the conclusion 
of the current inspection, our investigator provided you with a 
Form FDA 483a FSVP Observations. We have not received your 
response to the Form FDA 483a issued on April 19, 
2022. Your significant violation of the FSVP regulation is as 
follows: You did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP 
as required by section 805 of the FD&C Act and 
21 CFR section 1.502(a). Specifically, you did not develop an 
FSVP for any of the foods you import, including each 
of the following foods: During our inspection, you indicated you 
choose to comply with the requirements for very small importers 
and may meet the definition of a “very small importer” 
under 21 CFR 1.500. If you choose to comply with 
the modified requirements in 21 CFR 1.512, you must document 
that you meet the definition of a very small importer 
as required per 21 CFR 1.512(b)(1)(i). You are also still 
required to comply with the requirements in sections 1.502, 1.503, 
and 1.509. However, you are not required to comply with 
the requirements in sections 1.504 through 1.508 or 1.510. In 
addition, for each food you import, you must obtain written 
assurance, before importing the food and at least every 2 
years thereafter, that your foreign supplier is producing the food 
in compliance with processes and procedures that provide at least 
the same level of public health protection as those required 
under section 418 or 419 of the FD&C Act, if 
either is applicable, and the implementing regulations, and is producing 
the food in compliance with sections 402 and 403(w) (if 
applicable) of the FD&C Act (21 CFR 1.512(b)(3)(i)). The above 
violation is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of 
violations of the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to 
ensure that you are in compliance with section 805 of 
the FD&C Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR 
part 1, subpart L. This letter notifies you of our 
concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. If 
you do not adequately address this matter, we may take 
further action. For instance, we may take action under section 
801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse 
admission of the food you import for which you appear 
to be in violation of section 805. We may place 
the foods you import into the United States on detention 
without physical examination (DWPE) when you import the foods. You 
can find DWPE information relating to FSVP in Import Alert 
# 99-41 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or offering 
for importation into the United States of an article of 
food without the importer having an FSVP that meets the 
requirements of section 805 of the FD&C Act or the 
FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. 331(zz)). You should respond in writing within 
fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. 
Your response should address the specific things you are doing 
to correct any violations. You should include in your response 
documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your 
corrections (e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as a 
copy of your FSVPs, records to demonstrate implementation of your

TX 78503-8955 United States United States 10/14/2022 WARNING LETTER Re: 
CMS # 642138 


Dear Ms. Karla Gissel Soto Munoz, On 
July 28 – August 1, 2022, the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) conducted a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection 
of Fuentes Farms LLC located at 2501 W Military Hwy 
Ste C21-C22 McAllen, TX 78503-8955. We also conducted an inspection 
on December 15 – December 17, 2020. These inspections were 
conducted to determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) 
(21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 
CFR part 1, subpart L. The FSVP regulation requires that 
importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or 
animal food they import into the United States has been 
produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety 
standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP regulation 
and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links 
in FDA’s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals. During the most 
recent inspection, we found that you are not in compliance 
with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart L 
for the foods you import. Because of these significant violations, 
you are not in compliance with section 805 of the 
FD&C Act. At the conclusion of the inspection, our investigator 
provided you with a Form FDA 483a FSVP Observations. We 
have not received your response to the Form FDA 483a 
issued on August 1, 2022. Your significant violations of the 
FSVP regulation are as follows: 1. You did not develop, 
maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by section 805 
of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 1.502(a). Specifically, you 
did not develop an FSVP for any of the foods 
you import, including: You import fresh produce, that is “covered 
produce” as defined in 21 CFR 112.3. As an importer 
of covered produce, you must have an FSVP that demonstrates 
that your supplier is producing the food in compliance with 
processes and procedures that provide at least the same level 
of public health protection as those required under section 419 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 350h) (regarding standards 
for produce safety) and the implementing regulations in the Standards 
for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for 
Human Consumption (21 CFR part 112). The above violations are 
not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations of 
the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that 
you are in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C 
Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 1, 
subpart L. This letter notifies you of our concerns and 
provides you an opportunity to address them. If you do 
not adequately address this matter, we may take further action. 
For instance, we may take action under section 801(a)(3) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of 
the food you import for which you appear to be 
in violation of section 805. We may place the foods 
you import into the United States on detention without physical 
examination (DWPE) when you import the foods. You can find 
DWPE information relating to FSVP in Import Alert # 99-41 
at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or offering for importation 
into the United States of an article of food without 
the importer having an FSVP that meets the requirements of 
section 805 of the FD&C Act or the FSVP regulation 
is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. 331(zz)). You should respond in writing within fifteen (15) 
working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response 
should address the specific things you are doing to correct 
any violations. You should include in your response documentation and 
information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections (e.g., 
documentation of changes you made, such as a copy of 
your FSVP, records to demonstrate implementation of your FSVP), and 
any additional information that you wish to supply relevant to 
your compliance with the FSVP regulation. If you believe that 
you are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include 
your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If 
you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, you should

United States United States WARNING LETTER WL 635805 


Dear Mr. 
Roy: The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected 
your ambient and frozen warehouse and re-packing facility, located at 
2325 W. Charter Way, Stockton, CA 95206, from May 09-27, 
2022. During our inspection of your facility, the FDA investigators 
observed serious violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard 
Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food rule (CGMP 
& PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 
117 (21 CFR Part 117). At the conclusion of the 
inspection, the FDA investigators issued a Form FDA 483 (FDA-483), 
Inspectional Observations, listing the deviations found at your firm. In 
addition, during the inspection, FDA collected filth samples from various 
areas within your warehouse facility, and the analytical results revealed 
rodent, insect, or cat filth present all throughout your facility. 
Based on inspectional and analytical findings, we determined the food 
products packaged and/or held in your facility are adulterated within 
the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)] in 
that your products have been prepared, packed, or held under 
insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth 
or whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. 
You may find the Act and further information about the 
CGMP & PC rule through links on FDA’s homepage at 
www.fda.gov. Further, we have reviewed the Ghee product label that 
was collected during the inspection and found significant violations of 
the labeling regulations for foods, 21 CFR Part 101. These 
violations cause your product to be misbranded within the meaning 
of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343], 
as discussed below. (b)(4). Further, we received your written response 
to the FDA-483, dated June 07, 2022, which described corrective 
actions taken by your firm and included photographs and pest 
control service reports. Based on our review of the inspectional 
finding and the response that your firm provided, we are 
issuing this letter to advise you of FDA’s continuing concerns 
and to provide detailed information describing the findings at your 
facility. Current Good Manufacturing Practice (21 CFR Part 117, Subpart 
B) 1. You did not take effective measures to exclude 
pests from your packing and holding areas and to protect 
against the contamination of food on the premises by pests, 
as required by 21 CFR 117.35(c). Specifically, rodent, insect, and 
animal activity was observed throughout your facility including, but not 
limited to the following: Rodent Activity observed: Dry storage room 
at (b)(4) end of warehouse Southwest side of the warehouse 
Northwest side of the warehouse Inside (b)(4) freezer at the 
northwest end of warehouse Southeast end of the warehouse Insect 
activity observed: Animal activity observed: Structural deficiencies observed: Harborage areas 
inside the warehouse observed: Pest control records: In addition to 
visual observations, our investigators conducted a review of your third-party 
pest control provider inspection reports which revealed the following: Samples 
FDA collected several samples during the inspection (samples 1184925, 1176915, 
1182925, 1183037 and 1183038). These samples were submitted to FDA 
labs for analysis. Results demonstrate that submitted product [including (b)(4) 
(split chickpeas) and (b)(4) brand Paprika] were contaminated with rodent/mouse 
hairs, cat hair and urine, urine stains (on packaging), gnaw 
marks, REPs as well as various species of larval, pupal, 
and adult insects. Further, sample 1184925 had evidence of insect 
penetration and damage to packaging and product as well as 
urine stains and yeast. The filth samples further demonstrated the 
presence of rodents and insect activity throughout the facility through 
the presence of rodent hairs, teeth marks, in pellet morphology 
and nesting materials as well as confirmation of various species 
of insects at larval, pupae and adult stages. Your June 
7, 2022, written response indicated that you contracted with a 
new third-party pest control provider and increased service frequency (b)(4) 
a month. In addition, you described a treatment plan to 
gain control of your facility and remove all pest activity 
from the interior and exterior. Further, you provided service reports 
dated 05/26, 05/27, 05/31, and 06/03/2022; however, these reports do 
not show the frequency for routine service. Also, you did 
not provide confirmation of other actions promised by your response, 
such as (b)(4) application over a (b)(4) period, a (b)(4) 
rodent trapping program, and establishment of a bat exclusion program. 
In addition, your response indicated that all gaps and holes 
in doors have been repaired to eliminate pest route of 
entry. Further, you stated all areas of the facility, including 
warehouse, dry storage, walk-in freezer and packing room have been 
cleaned to remove rodent, animal, and insect filth. You also 
indicated that all affected product (damaged, expired, or containing urine 
stains or REPs) has been removed and discarded and that 
pallets have been moved away from walls for accessibility. However, 
you did not provide documentation to demonstrate repairs were made 
and the effectiveness of cleaning and pest removal, with the 
exception of the dry storage room. Further, you did not 
indicate how you plan to continue to maintain the facility 
and equipment in a sanitary condition. 2. You failed to 
properly store equipment, remove litter and waste, and cut weeds 
and grass that may constitute an attractant, breeding place, or 
harborage for pests within the immediate vicinity of the plant, 
as required by 117.20(a)(1). Specifically, In addition, on May 12, 
2022, the following food products slated for destruction were located 
outside on your grounds: Your Inventory Controller could not provide 
an estimate as to how long the food slated for 
destruction had been kept outside. This employee stated that dumpsters 
were ordered but could not give a time frame as 
to when they would arrive. Further, on May 23, 2022, 
hundreds of apparent REPs were found around all 6 downspouts 
of the gutter drainage systems outside and along the south 
wall of the firm. At least 100 apparent REPs were 
found around the downspout nearest to the visitor’s entrance of 
the firm. At least 300 apparent REPs were found around 
the 3rd downspout located at the center of the south 
wall. Apparent rodents were heard moving about the inside of 
the piping system that led this downspout. Your June 7 
response stated that all food product and food debris have 
been discarded from the yard area damaged pallets and materials 
have been removed, and the grounds have been cleaned to 
remove pests, litter, trash, spoiled food, and feces. You also 
indicated that four storage containers have been emptied, cleaned and 
the product discarded. However, you did not provide documentation to 
demonstrate that these activities were performed, with the exception of 
one photograph of the grounds along an unidentified exterior wall. 
Further, you did not indicate how you plan to continue 
to maintain your yard in a sanitary condition. Your written 
response also described processes established for the management of product 
slated for destruction. We are not able to fully evaluate 
the adequacy of this corrective action as you did not 
provide supporting documentation of its implementation. 3. You did not 
maintain your plant in a clean and sanitary condition and 
keep your plant in repair adequate to prevent food from 
becoming adulterated, as required by 21 CFR 117.35(a). Insanitary conditions 
around your facility demonstrated that sanitation and housekeeping operations were 
inadequate because your facility provided food sources and pest harborage 
areas for rodents and other pests which led to widespread 
product contamination. In addition, inadequate maintenance to parts of the 
facility allowed for potential pest entry and harborage areas within 
the facility. Specifically, during the inspection, on May 9, 2022, 
your firm identified 28 products that may be repacked in 
a dedicated room at your firm. Among these items are 
cashews, almonds, cumin powder, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, and coriander that 
may be ready-to eat (RTE) and (b)(4) packaged by employees 
within an open environment. The following was observed in your 
repack room during the inspection: Your June 7 response stated 
the packing room and equipment within have been cleaned and 
sanitized to remove dust and food debris. You also indicated 
that all infested product has been removed and discarded. Further, 
packaging materials have been cleaned. FDA will evaluate the adequacy 
cleaning and sanitation practices during our next inspection of your 
facility. Your written response described re-packing and record keeping processes 
which have been created; however, we are not able to 
fully evaluate the adequacy of this corrective action as you 
did not provide supporting documentation of its implementation. 4. You 
did not provide employees with adequate, readily accessible, and clean 
toilet facilities to prevent a potential source of contamination of 
food, food-contact surfaces, or food packaging materials, as required by 
21 CFR 117.35(d). Specifically: Your June 7 response stated that 
the employee and office bathrooms have been cleaned and fully 
stocked with hand soap, paper towels, toilet paper and seat-covers. 
It also stated that all sinks have been repaired, have 
hot and cold running water, and are stocked with hand 
soap and paper towels. Although you provided photographs which show 
the re-packaging equipment appears to be in sanitary condition, you 
did not provide photographs or other evidence to demonstrate the 
condition of the room or sinks. Also, you provided photographs 
to show a restroom and handwash station were cleaned and 
stocked appropriately; however, the locations are unknown. Further, you did 
not indicate how you plan to continue to maintain the 
facility (including bathrooms) in a sanitary condition. FDA will evaluate 
the adequacy cleaning and sanitation practices during our next inspection 
of your facility. Misbranding 1. Your 100% Pure Desi Ghee 
product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(w) of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 
U.S.C. § 343(w)] in that the finished product label fails 
to declare the major food allergen, milk. According to the 
label, this product is made from “Pure Grade AA Clarified 
Butter”, which is made from milk. We point out that 
in your response to the 483 (corrective action plan), there 
was no mention of correcting the labels. 2. Your 100% 
Pure Desi Ghee product is misbranded within the meaning of 
section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)] because there is a 
large discrepancy between serving size and servings per container information 
provided in the Nutrition Facts Label, when compared to the 
declared net quantity of contents. The net quantity of contents 
is double what would be calculated for the net quantity 
based on the information in the Nutrition Facts Label. If 
the declared serving size of 13g is multiplied by the 
declared 35 servings per container, the result is 455g, which 
is about one pound. However, the net quantity of contents 
for the product is declared as 2lb (32 FL OZ).” 
3. Your 100% Pure Desi Ghee product is misbranded within 
the meaning of section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)] because 
the serving size is not based on the appropriate RACC 
in accordance with 21 CFR 101.12(b)] and (21 CFR 101.9(b); 
therefore, all of the values in the nutrition label are 
incorrect. The label indicates a serving of “1/2 cup” (13 
g). The RACC for this product is under the category 
“Butter, margarine, oil, shortening” and has a reference amount of 
1 tbsp and a label statement of “1 tbsp (g) 
or 1 tbsp(15 mL).” Furthermore, we question whether ½ cup 
of this product would weigh 13 grams. 4. Your 100% 
Pure Desi ghee product is misbranded within the meaning of 
section 403(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 343(f)] because “desi” is a 
Hindi term; therefore, all required (mandatory) labeling must also be 
in Hindi, in accordance with section 21 CFR 101.15(c)(2). The 
violations cited in this letter are not intended to be 
an all-inclusive list of the violations that exist at your 
facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible 
for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified 
above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of 
other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure your facility 
complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations. 
You should take prompt action to correct or implement corrections 
to the violations cited in this letter. Failure to do 
so may result in legal action without further notice, including, 
without limitation, seizure, injunction, or administrative action for suspension of 
food facility registration if criteria and conditions warrant. Additionally, we 
reviewed your Shah Brand ghee product label and offer the 
following comments: Ghee is obtained from milk, cream or butter 
by removing the non-fat milk solids and water, and it 
typically contains about 99.6% or more milk fat (Codex Standard 
CXS 280-1973). Ghee is not considered a highly refined oil 
and is not exempt from major food allergen labeling requirements. 
Since ghee is prepared from milk, a major food allergen, 
the label must declare milk as the name of the 
food source from which the major food allergen is derived. 
The amount of non-fat milk solids, including milk proteins, present 
in ghee can vary depending on manufacturing process. The protein 
content of the ghee product must be determined for better 
evaluation of the risk posed by milk proteins remaining in 
ghee. The protein content in the Shah Brand ghee product 
is not known. The Nutrition Facts panel of its label 
indicates a serving size of ½ cup (13 g) and 
7g protein, which do not appear to be accurate. A 
search for nutrient composition of ghee at USDA database indicate 
0.28% protein in ghee1. This is equivalent to 0.039 g 
(39 mg) milk protein in a portion of 14 g 
(1 tablespoon) ghee. The current science on allergen risk assessment 
is based on population minimal eliciting dose (ED) distributions, which 
can be used to determine ED01 and ED05 doses at 
which 1% and 5% of the allergic population, respectively, can 
be expected to have allergic reaction1. Remington et al (2020)22estimated 
ED01 and ED05 for milk protein to be 0.2 mg 
and 2.4 mg, respectively, which is considerably lower than the 
milk protein that could be expected in 1 tablespoon of 
ghee. It can be anticipated that a serving size of 
1 tablespoon ghee with 39 mg milk protein can possibly 
cause allergic reaction in over 25% of milk allergic population 
based on the ED25 of 32.7 mg for milk protein 
reported by Houben et al (2020)33. We consider the milk 
proteins remaining in ghee can pose a significant concern of 
allergic reaction in milk allergic population. We also note the 
following: Please notify this office in writing within fifteen (15) 
working days of the receipt of this letter, as to 
the specific steps that you have taken to address these 
violations, including an explanation of each step being taken to 
prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as providing copies 
of related documentation. If you cannot complete addressing these violations 
within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay 
and the time within which you will do so. If 
you believe that your products are not in violation of 
the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for

United States United States August 19, 2022 WARNING LETTER 


Dear 
Donald Montgomery and Brianna Montgomery: The Center for Tobacco Products 
of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed 
the website https://rxvape.com and determined that e-liquid products listed there 
are manufactured and offered for sale or distribution to customers 
in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 
321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made 
or derived from tobacco or contain nicotine from any source, 
and are intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including 
e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 
C.F.R. § 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance 
with the requirements in the FD&C Act. Please be aware 
that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to 
amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA’s jurisdiction to products 
“containing nicotine from any source,” not just nicotine derived from 
tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division 
P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the 
definition of “tobacco product” under section 201(rr) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine 
from any source. Tobacco products, including e-liquid products containing nicotine 
from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C 
Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see 
https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14. Generally, to be legally marketed in the United States, 
the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a 
premarket authorization order in effect. A “new tobacco product” is 
any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the 
United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified 
tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 
(section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). 
Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a 
new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product 
submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding 
the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 
910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted 
a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions 
from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under 
section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)). 
New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and 
Misbranded Our review of the website https://rxvape.com revealed that you 
manufacture and offer for sale or distribution to customers in 
the United States e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order, 
including: TFN Virginia Tobacco Nicotine Salts E-liquid Vape – 60 
mL (Big Mouth Unicorn) and TFN Virginia Tobacco Nicotine Salts 
E-liquid Vape – 30 mL (PET). The e-liquid products listed 
above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially 
marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. 
These products do not have an FDA marketing authorization order 
in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and 
are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, 
these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C 
Act. In addition, these products are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) 
of the FD&C Act because a notice or other information 
respecting these products was not provided as required by section 
905(j) of the FD&C Act. Conclusion and Requested Actions FDA 
has not received an application from your firm requesting marketing 
authorization for the products listed in this Warning Letter. These 
products and any other new tobacco products on the market 
without the statutorily required premarket authorization are adulterated and misbranded 
and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. The 
violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an 
exhaustive list. You should address any violations that are referenced 
above, as well as violations that are the same as 
or similar to those stated above, and promptly take any 
necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with 
the FD&C Act. It is your responsibility to ensure that 
your tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on 
this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, 
or search engine websites), in any other media in which 
you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each 
applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. 
Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 
U.S.C. § 301 et seq., and implementing regulations relating to 
tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 
1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, 
but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. 
However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for 
purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note 
that tobacco products offered for import into the United States 
that appear to be adulterated or misbranded may be detained 
or refused admission. Please submit a written response to this 
letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt 
describing your actions to address any violations and bring your 
products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued 
the violative labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco 
products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C 
Act. If you believe that your products are not in 
violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any 
supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of 
our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address 
them. You can find the FD&C Act through links on 
FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov. Please note your reference number, RW2201823,

Dear Sabrina 
Cosmetics d/b/a SCOS: The Center for Tobacco Products of the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed the website 
https://sabrinacosmeticss.info and determined that electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) products 
listed there are offered for sale or distribution to customers 
in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 
321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made 
or derived from tobacco or contain nicotine from any source 
and are intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including 
ENDS products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 
C.F.R. § 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance 
with the requirements in the FD&C Act. Please be aware 
that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to 
amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA’s jurisdiction to products 
“containing nicotine from any source,” not just nicotine derived from 
tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division

Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine 
from any source. As of April 14, 2022, it is 
illegal for a retailer to sell any tobacco product, containing 
nicotine from any source – including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, 
and e-cigarettes – to anyone under 21. Tobacco Product Sold 
to an Individual Under the Age of 21 is Misbranded 
FDA has determined that your Mixed Berry Bundle product containing 
a PUFF Plus Mixed Berries Disposable ENDS product is misbranded 
under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387c(a)(7)(B)) because this product was sold to a person younger 
than 21 years of age. FDA’s investigation of the website 
https://sabrinacosmeticss.info revealed that you sold an ENDS product to an 
individual under the age of 21. Specifically, during our investigation 
of https://sabrinacosmeticss.info, a person younger than 21 years of age 
purchased your Mixed Berry Bundle product containing a PUFF Plus 
Mixed Berries Disposable ENDS product from your website. No retailer 
may sell tobacco products to a person younger than 21 
years of age under section 906(d)(5) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387f(d)(5)). Under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)), tobacco products are misbranded if 
sold or distributed in violation of section 906(d)(5) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387f(d)(5)). Because this tobacco product 
is sold or distributed to persons younger than 21 years 
of age in violation of section 906(d)(5) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387f(d)(5)), this product is misbranded under 
section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)). 
Marketing Tobacco Products in Combination with Any Other FDA Regulated 
Product Violation Additionally, FDA has determined that your Mixed Berry 
Bundle product containing a PUFF Plus Mixed Berries Disposable ENDS 
product violates section 201(rr)(4) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 321(rr)(4)) because it is marketed in combination with cosmetic 
products. FDA’s investigation of the website https://sabrinacosmeticss.info revealed that it 
markets and co-packages for sale PUFF Plus Mixed Berries Disposable 
ENDS product in combination with cosmetic products. Under section 201(rr)(4) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)(4)), a tobacco 
product shall not be marketed in combination with any other 
article or product regulated under the FD&C Act, including a 
drug, biologic, food, cosmetic, medical device, or dietary supplement. You 
marketed and co-packaged for sale PUFF Plus Mixed Berries Disposable 
ENDS in combination with Max Makeup Cherimoya Lip Polish, Broadway 
Argan Oil Lip Gloss, and false eyelashes cosmetic products that 
are regulated under the FD&C Act. Accordingly, you violated the

Dear 
Aarin Mock: The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions to 
the FDA and our inspection records, and determined that 3rd 
Rock Vapor Inc manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for commercial 
distribution in the United States, and that the e-liquid products 
are manufactured and offered for sale or distribution to customers 
in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 
321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made 
or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain 
tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction 
under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1, Therefore, these products are 
required to be in compliance with the requirements in the 
FD&C Act. Please be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, 
FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition of a tobacco 
product, except accessories to these newly deemed products, to be 
subject to regulation under the FD&C Act. These products include, 
but are not limited to, electronic nicotine delivery systems (including 
e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, 
Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking 
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and 
Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco 
Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at 
https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. The FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have 
a premarket authorization in effect. A “new tobacco product” is 
any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the 
United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified 
tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 
(section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). 
Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a 
new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product 
submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding 
the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 
910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted 
a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions 
from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under 
section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).New 
Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded 
FDA has determined that you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to 
customers in the United States Blue Raspberry e-liquid products without 
a marketing authorization order. The tobacco products listed above are 
new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in 
the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products 
do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under 
section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise 
exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are 
adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a 
notice or other information respecting these products were not provided 
as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. The 
doing of any act with respect to a tobacco product 
while such article is held for sale after shipment in 
interstate commerce which results in such product being adulterated or 
misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, to the extent 
that a report was required under section 905(j) of the 
FD&C Act, the failure to provide such report is a 
prohibited act under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 331(p)). Conclusion and Requested Actions All new tobacco 
products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization 
are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at 
FDA’s discretion. Products for which no application is pending, including, 
for example, those with a Marketing Denial Order and those 
for which no application was submitted, are among our highest 
enforcement priorities. For information on how FDA intends to prioritize 
enforcement resources with regard to the marketing of certain adulterated 
and misbranded ENDS and other deemed new tobacco products, please 
refer to the FDA’s guidance titled Enforcement Priorities for Electronic 
Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the 
Market Without Premarket Authorization, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market. It is your 
responsibility to ensure that all of your tobacco products comply 
with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s 
implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C 
Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating 
to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. 
Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, 
including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or 
injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” 
for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please 
note that tobacco products offered for import into the United 
States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be 
detained or refused admission. The violations discussed in this letter 
do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take 
prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above,

TX 75601 United States United States January 26, 2023 WARNING 
LETTER 


Dear Mr. Thompson: The Center for Tobacco Products of 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your 
submissions to the FDA and our inspection records, and determined 
that Zombieland, LLC d/b/a Mafia Street Vapor Company manufactures and 
distributes e-liquid products for commercial distribution in the United States, 
and that the e-liquid products are manufactured and offered for 
sale or distribution to customers in the United States. Under 
section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco 
products because they are made or derived from tobacco or 
contain nicotine from any source, and intended for human consumption. 
Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA 
jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1, and are required 
to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C 
Act. Please be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the 
President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend 
FDA’s jurisdiction to products “containing nicotine from any source,” not 
just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, 
Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, 
this legislation expanded the definition of “tobacco product” under section 
201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to 
include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including 
e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in 
compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For 
more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14. The FD&C Act requires “new 
tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization in effect. A 
“new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not 
commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 
2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed 
after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 
21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under 
section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) 
is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the 
manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA 
issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a 
predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or 
(2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications 
are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence 
granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)). A New Tobacco Product Without Required 
Marketing Authorization Is Adulterated and Misbranded FDA has determined that 
you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to customers in the United 
States Mafia Street Vapor Company Razzle 3 nicotine e-liquid product 
without a marketing authorization order. The tobacco product listed above 
is a new tobacco product because it was not commercially 
marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. 
This product does not have an FDA marketing authorization order 
in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and 
is not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, 
this product is adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, it is misbranded 
under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting this product 
was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the 
FD&C Act. The doing of any act with respect to 
a tobacco product while such article is held for sale 
after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such product 
being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited act under section 
301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, 
to the extent that a report was required under section 
905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure to provide such 
report is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)). Conclusion and Requested Actions 
FDA has not received an application from your firm requesting 
marketing authorization for the product listed in this Warning Letter. 
This product and any other new tobacco product on the 
market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are adulterated and 
misbranded and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. 
It is your responsibility to ensure that all of your

MD 20814-2454 United States United States WARNING LETTER CMS# 643192 
December 20, 2022 


Dear Mr. Gross: During an inspection of 
your firm located at 7979 Old Georgetown Road, Suite 801, 
Bethesda, MD 20814-2454 on June 28 through July 08, 2022, 
investigators from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
determined that your firm is a manufacturer of the RightEye 
Vision System, a Class 2 Nystagmograph medical device under 21 
CFR 882.1460. RightEye is intended for recording, viewing, and analyzing 
eye movements in support of diagnosing visual tracking impairment in 
human subjects. Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), this 
product is a device because it is intended for use 
in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in 
the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to 
affect the structure or any function of the body. We 
received a response from you, dated July 29, 2022, and 
responses from Melissa Hunfalvay, Chief Science Officer & Co-Founder, dated 
October 07, 2022, and December 13, 2022, concerning our investigator’s 
observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List 
of Inspectional Observations, that was issued to your firm. We 
address these responses below, in relation to each of the 
noted violations. The inspection revealed that the RightEye Vision System 
device is adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 
U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an 
approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to 
section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or 
an approved application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under 
section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g) for 
the device as described and marketed. Additionally, the RightEye Vision 
System is also misbranded under section 502(o) the Act, 21 
U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm introduced or delivered for 
introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution this device with 
major changes or modifications to the intended use without submitting 
a new premarket notification to FDA as required by section 
510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), and 21 
CFR 807.81(a)(3)(ii). Specifically, the RightEye Vision System was cleared under 
K181771 with the following indications: “recording, viewing, and analyzing eye 
movements in support of identifying visual tracking impairment in human 
subjects.” However, your firm’s promotion of the device provides evidence 
that the device is intended to improve vision problems and 
measure and analyze eye movements for the broader genre of 
“neurological disorders,” including Parkinson’s disease, which would constitute a major 
change or modification to its intended use for which your 
firm lacks clearance or approval. Examples include: The RightEye Vision 
System has not been cleared to “improve vision problems.” Such 
off-label use of the device may interfere with traditional standard 
of care treatment and a delay may put patients at 
risk. For example, if the device were used for amblyopia 
treatment in children instead of clinical standard of care (e.g., 
patching), the critical time interval when such treatment will be 
effective may be lost. This raises significant safety concerns. In 
addition, the RightEye Vision System has not been cleared to 
aid in the assessment or diagnosis of neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., 
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder or “ADHD”), mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or 
concussion, or neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease). Your firm links 
the device’s utility to track eye movements to the diagnosis 
of specific neurological conditions from eye movement tracking, which falls 
outside the cleared indications for use of the device. For 
example, as identified above, your firm states that “RightEye EyeQ 
tests help health care providers assess patients’ brain health, visual 
dysfunction, concussions, reading disorders.” While your firm notes that vision 
problems may exist in certain patients with these conditions, FDA 
has not yet evaluated whether this device can detect vision 
abnormalities specific to these conditions. Such off-label use to aid 
in the diagnosis of ADHD, mTBI, or Parkinson’s disease may 
result in misdiagnosis or a delay in diagnosis due to 
a clinician's reliance on inaccurate or irrelevant information provided by 
the device. This may result in delayed treatment or care 
in the cases of ADHD and Parkinson’s disease. In the 
case of mTBI, this may result in serious further injury 
if an initial injury is misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, the patient 
therefore is not appropriately managed and does not take adequate 
care or precautions, and the patient suffers a second mTBI. 
Second impact syndrome, although rare when patients are properly managed, 
is most often fatal. We reviewed your firm’s responses and 
concluded they are not adequate. Your letters indicated that a 
full assessment of your Quality System is planned but did 
not include your plans to implement specific corrective actions regarding 
off-label promotion of your device beyond its cleared indications for 
use. In addition, your RightEye Vision System device is misbranded 
within the meaning of section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 21 
U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that there was a failure or 
refusal to furnish any material or information required by or 
under section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, 
respecting the device. In particular, 21 CFR 830.300(a) and 830.320(b), 
both of which were promulgated under section 519 of the 
Act, among other provisions, require, with exceptions not relevant here, 
that the labeler of a device submit electronically to FDA’s 
Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) the information required by 
21 CFR 830, subpart E, for each version or model 
required to bear a UDI. Your firm is a “labeler” 
within the meaning of 21 CFR 830.3 and has not 
submitted to GUDID any information required by 21 CFR 830, 
subpart E, respecting this device. The failure or refusal to 
furnish any notification or other material or information required by 
or under section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 
360i, also constitutes a prohibited act under section 301(q)(1)(B) of 
the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(q)(1)(B). We reviewed your firm’s 
responses and concluded they are not adequate. Your letters indicated 
that a full assessment of your Quality System is planned 
but did not include your plans to implement specific corrective 
actions regarding your product labels/labeling. This inspection also revealed that 
this device is adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) 
of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the 
methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, 
its manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity 
with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality 
System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR), Part 820. These violations include, but are not limited 
to, the following: 1. Failure to establish and maintain procedures 
to control the design of the device to ensure that 
specified design requirements are met, as required by 21 CFR 
820.30. Specifically, your firm has no written design control procedures. 
We reviewed your firm’s responses and concluded they are not 
adequate. Your letters indicated that a full assessment of your 
Quality System is planned but did not include your plans 
to implement specific corrective actions. 2. Failure to establish and 
maintain a design history file (DHF) that contains or references 
the records necessary to demonstrate that the design was developed 
in accordance with the approved design plan and design control 
requirements, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(j). Specifically, your DHF 
for the RightEye Vision System device does not include nor 
reference the location of supporting documentation related to design and 
development planning, design input, design output, design review, design verification, 
design validation, risk management/risk analysis, and design transfer. We reviewed 
your firm’s responses and concluded they are not adequate. Your 
letters indicated that a full assessment of your Quality System 
is planned but did not include your plans to implement 
specific corrective actions. 3. Failure to establish and maintain procedures 
for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints, as required by 21 
CFR 820.198(a). Specifically, your complaint handling procedure, Complaint Handling Document 
# RE_SOP_1.0.2 Complaint Handling Rev. 1.0.2, dated 06/24/2022, does not 
address the requirement that all complaints be evaluated to determine 
whether the complaint represents an event which is required to 
be reported to FDA under 21 CFR 803, Medical Device 
Reporting. Additionally, your complaint handling procedure does not address reviewing 
and evaluating all complaints to determine whether an investigation is 
necessary, nor does it require that when no investigation is 
made, a record be maintained that includes the reason no 
investigation was made. Furthermore, 7 of the 7 complaint files 
reviewed during this inspection were not evaluated to determine whether 
the complaint represents an event which is required to be 
reported to FDA under 21 CFR 803, Medical Device Reporting; 
and were not reviewed or evaluated to determine whether an 
investigation is necessary, and no investigation was made. We reviewed 
your firm’s responses and concluded they are not adequate. Your 
letters indicated that a full assessment of your Quality System 
is planned but did not include your plans to implement 
specific corrective actions. 4. Failure to establish and maintain procedures 
to control product that does not conform to specified required, 
as required by 21 CFR 820.90. Specifically, you have not 
established procedures concerning the control of nonconforming product. We reviewed 
your firm’s responses and concluded they are not adequate. Your 
letters indicated that a full assessment of your Quality System 
is planned but did not include your plans to implement 
specific corrective actions. 5. You have not established or maintained 
the requirements, including quality requirements, that must be met by 
suppliers, contractors, and consultants. For example, your firm relies on 
suppliers to contract manufacture critical hardware of the RightEye Vision 
System device, per your component specifications. Failure to establish and 
maintain the requirements, including quality requirements, that must be met 
by suppliers, contractors, and consultants, as required by 21 CFR 
820.50(a). We reviewed your firm’s responses and concluded they are 
not adequate. Your letters indicated that a full assessment of 
your Quality System is planned but did not include your 
plans to implement specific corrective actions. Your firm should take 
prompt action to address any violations identified in this letter. 
Failure to adequately address this matter may result in regulatory 
action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These 
actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and 
civil money penalties. Other federal agencies may take your compliance 
with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations into account 
when considering the award of federal contracts. Additionally, should FDA 
determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are 
reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, 
such devices will not be approved until the violations have 
been addressed. Should FDA determine that your devices or facilities 
do not meet the requirements of the Act, requests for 
Certificates to Foreign Governments (CFG) may not be granted. Please 
notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from 
the date you receive this letter of the specific steps 
your firm has taken to address the noted violations, as 
well as an explanation of how your firm plans to 
prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include 
documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address 
systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s 
planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please 
include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections 
and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, 
state the reason for the delay and the time within 
which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should 
be comprehensive and address any violations included in this Warning 
Letter. If you believe that your products are not in 
violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any 
supporting information for our consideration as part of your response. 
Your firm’s response should be sent to: Gina Brackett, Director 
of Compliance Branch, at oradevices1firmresponse@fda.hhs.gov. Refer to CMS # 643192 
when replying. If you have any questions about the contents 
of this letter, please contact: Katelyn Staub-Zamperini, Compliance Officer, at 
(412) 644-3394 ext. 20 or katelyn.staub-zamperini@fda.hhs.gov. Finally, you should know 
that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive 
list of the violations at your firm’s facility. It is 
your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this 
letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at 
the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious 
problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems. Your 
firm should investigate and determine the causes of any violations 
and take prompt actions to address any violations and bring 
the products into compliance.

NY 10965 United States United States Warning Letter #635791 December 
27, 2022 


Dear Mr. Banerjee: Your facility was registered with 
the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) 
as a manufacturer of over-the-counter (OTC) drug products, including consumer 
antiseptic hand rub drug products (also referred to as consumer 
hand sanitizers) until October 24, 2022 and you distributed hand 
sanitizer drug products as recently as August 31, 2022. FDA 
conducted testing of your consumer hand sanitizer drug products1. These 
drug products were manufactured at your facility, Urban Electric Power, 
FEI 3016759092, located at 401 N Middletown Road, Bldg. 155, 
Pearl River. The results of the FDA laboratory testing of 
batches of these drug products demonstrate that these drug products 
manufactured at your facility are adulterated within the meaning of 
section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B))2, in that contamination with 
the impurities acetaldehyde and acetal at unacceptable levels demonstrates that 
the quality assurance within your facility is not functioning in 
accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements. Additionally, FDA 
has reviewed your September 8, 2022 response to our information 
request letter dated July 28, 2022, which notified you of 
the adverse findings and requested clarification of your manufacturing operations, 
and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence. Because your methods, 
facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding of 
drugs as described in your response do not conform to 
CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of 
section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)). Adulteration 
Violations You manufactured ohm BY URBAN ELECTRIC POWER hand sanitizer 
and sanitizer spray at your facility. FDA collected (b)(4) batches 
of your drug products and FDA laboratory testing of your 
products found that all four batches of the drug products 
contained acetaldehyde and acetal impurities at unacceptable levels. See table 
below. Product Name Test Results (ppm) ohm BY URBAN ELECTRIC

POWER, hand sanitizer, 70% ALCOHOL BY VOLUME, GEL BASED, FRESH 
SCENT, 12 FL OZ (355ML), EXP. DATE: JUNE 2023 Acetaldehyde 
(b)(4) Acetal (b)(4) Acetaldehyde and acetal are known impurities of 
alcohol, as delineated in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). The 
USP monograph for alcohol limits acetaldehyde and acetal to not 
more than (NMT) 10μL/L, 10 ppm (expressed as acetaldehyde). Alcohol 
not meeting the specification for acetaldehyde and acetal is deemed 
adulterated under section 501(b) of the FD&C Act. Alcohol represents 
a significant component of your drug product; therefore, you must 
have a specification for acetaldehyde and acetal per 21 CFR 
211.160(b). Further, finished product testing of each batch of drug 
product is required under 21 CFR 211.165. The test results 
for acetaldehyde and acetal impurities in your drug products are 
unacceptable because these results are higher than the levels expected 
if the alcohol contained in your products complied with compendial 
standards and if you had conducted finished product testing with 
a specification for acetaldehyde and acetal. Therefore, your drug products 
are deemed adulterated under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act. 
Acetaldehyde appears to be genotoxic, and potentially carcinogenic, when in 
direct contact with tissues. On July 28, 2022, FDA sent 
you an information request letter informing you of the unacceptable 
levels of impurities in your ohm BY URBAN ELECTRIC POWER 
hand sanitizer and sanitizer spray and requested additional information including 
impurity testing of reserve samples to determine the quality of 
all batches of your hand sanitizer drug products within expiry.3 
Your response dated September 8, 2022 indicated you manufactured hand 
sanitizer through March 2022 and distributed hand sanitizer drug products 
as recently as August 31, 2022. In our information request 
we asked whether you could test reserve samples to test 
the quality of your product. Your response dated September 8, 
2022 indicated you “do not have retain samples and therefore 
cannot test them to determine batch quality.” Not having reserve 
samples for distributed drug products is a violation of CGMP 
(21 CFR 211.170(b)). FDA is concerned about the quality of 
your distributed hand sanitizer drug products because all batches of 
your drug products FDA tested contained unacceptable levels of acetaldehyde 
and acetal impurities and you are unable to test retain 
samples to ascertain the quality of other lots you distributed. 
On October 18, 2022, FDA held a teleconference with you. 
We recommended you consider removing all of your OTC hand 
sanitizer drug products currently in distribution and within labeled expiry. 
To date, you have yet to initiate a recall. On 
November 9, 2022, FDA notified the public of the unacceptable 
impurity results in your hand sanitizer drugs products at the 
following website: https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-consumers-should-not-use The contamination with acetaldehyde and acetal in 
drug products manufactured in your facility, in addition to the 
deficiencies in your response to the information we requested, demonstrate 
that the quality assurance within your facility is not functioning 
in accordance with CGMP requirements under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the 
FD&C Act. CGMP Consultant Recommended Based upon the nature of 
the violations we identified, you should engage a consultant qualified 
as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34 to assist your 
firm in meeting CGMP requirements if your firm intends to 
resume manufacturing drugs for the U.S. market. The qualified consultant 
should also perform a comprehensive audit of your entire operation 
for CGMP compliance and evaluate the completion and efficacy of 
your corrective actions and preventive actions before you pursue resolution 
of your firm’s compliance status with FDA. Your use of 
a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply 
with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving 
all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance. 
Drug Production Ceased We acknowledge your commitment to cease production 
of drugs at this facility and your response on September 
8, 2022 stated you “do not intend to continue manufacturing 
hand sanitizer drug products.” If you plan to resume manufacturing 
drugs, notify this office before resuming your operations. Conclusion The 
violations cited in this letter are not intended to be 
an all-inclusive list of violations associated with your drug products. 
You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of 
any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence 
of other violations. Correct any violations promptly. Failure to promptly 
and adequately address this matter may result in regulatory or 
legal action without further notice including, without limitation, seizure and 
injunction. Unresolved violations may also prevent other Federal agencies from 
awarding contracts. Failure to address violations may also cause FDA 
to withhold issuance of Export Certificates. FDA may withhold approval 
of new applications or supplements listing your firm as a 
drug manufacturer until any violations are completely addressed and we 
confirm your compliance with CGMP. We may inspect to verify 
that you have completed corrective actions to address any violations. 
This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you 
an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. After you receive 
this letter, respond to this office in writing within 15 
working days. Specify what you have done to address any 
violations and to prevent their recurrence. In response to this 
letter, you may provide additional information for our consideration as 
we continue to assess your activities and practices. If you 
cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state your 
reasons for delay and your schedule for completion. Send your 
electronic reply to CDER-OC-OMQ-Communications@fda.hhs.gov ATTN: Lynnsey Renn. Also please send 
your electronic supply to Nancy Espinal, Compliance Officer and ORAPHARM1_RESPONSES@fda.hhs.gov

FRESH SCENT, 10 FL OZ (295ML); ohm BY URBAN ELECTRIC 
POWER, hand sanitizer, 70% ALCOHOL BY VOLUME, GEL BASED, FRESH 
SCENT, 12 FL OZ (355ML) 2 Due to an increased 
demand for alcohol-based hand sanitizers during the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
FDA published the Guidance for Industry: Temporary Policy for Preparation 
of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the Public Health 
Emergency (COVID-19) on March 19, 2020, and subsequently updated the 
guidance several times. The guidance was withdrawn effective December 31, 
2021 (86 Fed Reg at 56960). This guidance communicated the 
agency’s temporary policy that we did not intend to take 
action against firms for CGMP violations under section 501(a)(2)(B) of 
the FD&C Act if such firms prepared alcohol-based hand sanitizers 
for consumer use (or for use as a health care 
personnel hand rub) during the public health emergency, provided certain 
circumstances described in the guidance are present. These circumstances included 
preparation of hand sanitizer products using only the ingredients and 
formulas set forth in the guidance. Because Urban Electric Power 
hand sanitizer drug products were not consistent with the formulations 
described in these guidances, they did not fall within any 
temporary agency policy not to take action against firms manufacturing 
hand sanitizer products for violations of section 505 of the 
FD&C Act. 3 In the July 28, 2022 letter, FDA 
had described “unacceptable” levels of acetal and acetaldehyde as being 
above 50 ppm. That number had originally been described in 
the Temporary Policy for Preparation of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer 
Products During the Public Health Emergency (COVID-19) and had represented 
FDA’s intent to not take action against products within that 
level of impurity, provided that the other circumstances described in 
the guidance were present. As noted in FN2 above, that 
temporary policy has been withdrawn. Acetal and acetaldehyde levels in 
alcohol must not exceed the 10 ppm limit prescribed by 
the USP. 01/31/2023 More Warning Letters "

Dear Mr. Schreyer: Your facility was registered with the United 
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) as a 
manufacturer of over-the-counter (OTC) drug products, including consumer antiseptic hand 
rub drug products (also referred to as consumer hand sanitizers) 
until June 10, 2022 and you distributed hand sanitizer drug 
products as recently as April 19, 2022. These drug products 
were manufactured at your facility, Mohawk Laboratories, Division of NCH 
Corporation, FEI 1610021, located at 2730 Carl Road, Irving, TX. 
FDA conducted testing of three lots of your consumer hand 
sanitizer drug products1. Your firm also provided impurity test results 
for additional lots of consumer hand sanitizer, labeled as Alcohol 
Antiseptic, 80% Topical Solution, Hand Sanitizer. The results of the 
FDA laboratory testing of lots of your drug products and 
the results of testing of additional lots provided by your 
firm demonstrate that these drug products manufactured at your facility 
are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 
U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)),2 in that contamination with the impurities acetaldehyde and 
acetal at unacceptable levels demonstrates that the quality assurance within 
your facility is not functioning in accordance with Current Good 
Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements. Additionally, FDA has reviewed your September 
6,2022 response to our information request letter dated July 28, 
2022, which notified you of the adverse findings and requested 
clarification of your manufacturing operations, and acknowledge receipt of your 
subsequent correspondence. Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, 
processing, packing, or holding of drugs as described in your 
response do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are 
adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)). Adulteration Violations You manufactured Alcohol Antiseptic, 
80% Topical Solution, Hand Sanitizer at your facility. FDA collected 
three lots of your drug products and FDA laboratory testing 
of your products found that all three lots of the 
drug products contained acetaldehyde and acetal impurities at unacceptable levels.

Dear Rozan Kitchen: This letter is to advise you 
that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed 
your website at the Internet address, www.oldtilesdecor.com, on October 11, 
2022, and observed that your website offers “Wind River Skin 
Comfort Blend,” “Wind River Cayenne Tincture,” and “Wind River Elderberry 
Tincture” for sale in the United States. Based on our 
review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation 
of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your 
“Wind River Skin Comfort Blend” and “Wind River Cayenne Tincture” 
products are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C 
Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). As explained further below, introducing or 
delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates section 
301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a) 
and (d). The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
has determined that a public health emergency exists nationwide involving 
mpox.1,2 Therefore, FDA is taking measures to protect customers from 
products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to 
mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure mpox. As described below, 
you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, 
diagnose, or cure mpox in people. We request that you 
cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for 
the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of mpox. Unapproved 
New Human Drugs Based on a review of your website, 
your “Wind River Skin Comfort Blend,” “Wind River Cayenne Tincture,” 
and “Wind River Elderberry Tincture” products are drugs under section 
201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they 
are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, 
or prevention of disease, and/or intended to affect the structure 
or any function of the body. Examples of claims from 
your website, www.oldtilesdecor.com, that provide evidence of the intended use 
of these products as drugs include, but may not be 
limited to, the following: On the product webpage for “Wind 
River Skin Comfort Blend,” https://oldtilesdecor.com/products/wind-river-skin-comfort-monkeypox-colloidal-silver-blend-4-oz-peppermint-essential-spikenard-oil-sarracenia-purpurea-homeopathic-relief: • “This skin remedy boosts 
skin health with a powerful antibiotic, antimicrobial, anti-fungal, anti-itch essential 
oil remedy.” • “Sarracenia Purpurea was used by the Native 
Americans for generations, for Smallpox. May help with Monkeypox sores.” 
On the product webpage for “Wind River Cayenne Tincture,” https://oldtilesdecor.com/products/wind-river-cayenne-tincture-non-alcoholic-homeopathic-relief: 
• “IWind River Cayenne Pepper Tincture for boosting heart health. 
Cayenne Pepper is a fantastic source of antioxidants and other 
plant compounds that protect our cells and promote health. f 
you are worried about heart issues, high blood pressure, blood 
clots, myocarditis, etc, having this, or simply cayenne pepper in 
your cupboard can save a life. Administer under the tongue, 
while calling 911.” On the product webpage for “Wind River 
Elderberry Tincture,” on https://oldtilesdecor.com/products/wind-river-elderberry-syrup-non-alcoholic-homeopathic-relief: • “Wind River Elderberry Syrup Tincture 
is packed with antioxidants and vitamins that boost your immune 
system.” • “It is a remedy to tame inflammation, lessen 
stress, and help protect your heart, too.” • “Recommended to 
help prevent and ease cold and flu symptoms.” In addition, 
FDA is particularly concerned that you market your “Wind River 
Elderberry Tincture” for use in preventing cold and flu symptoms 
in children and infants. For example, the label of this 
product states in part, “Child: Half adult dose. Infant/Toddler: Ask 
your doctor. Or 1 tsp every 4 hours.” Your products 
have not been evaluated by FDA for safety, effectiveness, and 
quality. The use of untested drugs can have unpredictable and 
unintended consequences, especially in vulnerable populations such as children and 
infants who may be at greater risk for adverse reactions 
associated with certain drug products due to differences in the 
ability of children to absorb, metabolize, distribute, or excrete such 
drug products or their metabolites. Your “Wind River Skin Comfort 
Blend,” “Wind River Cayenne Tincture,” and “Wind River Elderberry Tincture” 
products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for 
their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new 
drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may 
not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate 
commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 
301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). 
Misbranded Human Drugs Your “Wind River Skin Comfort Blend” and 
“Wind River Cayenne Tincture” products are misbranded within the meaning 
of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), 
in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for 
their intended uses. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under 
which a layperson can use a drug safely and for 
the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 
201.5.) Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the 
Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A), can only be used safely at 
the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. 
Your “Wind River Skin Comfort Blend” and “Wind River Cayenne 
Tincture” products are offered for conditions that are not amenable 
to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed 
practitioner. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so 
that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their 
intended purposes. Accordingly, the listed products are misbranded under section 
502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). The introduction 
or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded drugs 
violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). 
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement 
of violations that may exist in connection with your products. 
You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of 
any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence 
of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that 
your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including 
FDA regulations. This letter notifies you of our concerns and 
provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately 
address this matter may result in legal action including, without 
limitation, seizure and injunction. Please notify FDA in writing, within 
fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the 
specific steps you have taken to address these matters. Include 
an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the 
recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. 
If you believe that your products are not in violation 
of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting 
information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action 
within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay 
and the time within which you will complete the correction.

States WARNING LETTER CC: Amazon Associates Program Regulatory-inquiries@amazon.com RE: #644773 



Dear Eric Sminia: This letter is to advise you that 
on October 31, 2022, the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.monkeypox-treatment.com. 
While reviewing your website, FDA observed that you participate in 
the Amazon Associates program. As an Amazon Associate, you earn 
commissions by promoting the sale of various products with claims 
on your website representing or implying that the products can 
mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure mpox1 in people, including 
but not limited to such as Advil, Aleve, Tylenol 8HR, 
Amazon Children’s Ibuprofen, Amazon Hydrocortisone 1% Lotion, and A+D PREVENT, 
as well as Garden of Life B12 Vitamin, and Crystal 
Star Adrenal Support (hereinafter these products are referred to as 
“Amazon associate products”).2, 3 Based on our review, these claims 
cause these products, which are purchased through links on your 
website, to be unapproved new drugs under section 505(a) of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 
U.S.C. 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 
502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). Causing the 
introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate 
commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a) and (d). In addition, it 
is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C 
Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(k), to do any act with respect 
to a drug, if such act is done while the 
drug is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce 
and results in the drug being misbranded. The Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS) has determined that a public 
health emergency exists nationwide involving mpox.4 Therefore, FDA is taking 
measures to protect customers from products that, without approval or 
authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or 
cure mpox. As described below, you sell products that are 
intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure mpox in 
people. We request that you cease the sale of any 
unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, 
or cure of mpox. Unapproved New Human Drugs Some examples 
of the claims on your website that establish the intended 
use of your Amazon associate products as safe and/or effective 
for the treatment or prevention of mpox include: On your 
homepage, https://monkeypox-treatment.com/: • “MONKEYPOX TREATMENT” • “TREATMENT AND PREVENTION FROM 
MONKEYPOX. . .SHOP FROM OVER 500 PRODUCTS. . .VISIT STORE” 
On your page, https://monkeypox-treatment.com/product-category/monkeypox-fever-reducer/: • Advil, Aleve, and Amazon Children’s 
Ibuprofen include the statement “MONKEYPOX FEVER REDUCER” in the product 
description and are listed under the “MONKEYPOX FEVER REDUCER” category. 
On your page, https://monkeypox-treatment.com/product-category/monkeypox-muscle-aches-pain-relief/page/6/: • Tylenol 8HR includes the statement 
“MONKEYPOX MUSCLE ACHES & PAIN RELIEF” in the product description 
and is listed under the “MONKEYPOX MUSCLE ACHES & PAIN 
RELIEF” category. On your page, https://monkeypox-treatment.com/product-category/monkeypox-rash-cream/: • A+D PREVENT, and 
Amazon Hydrocortisone 1% Lotion includes the statement “MONKEYPOX RASH CREAM” 
in the product description and are listed under the “MONKEYPOX 
RASH CREAM” category. On your page, https://monkeypox-treatment.com/product-category/monkeypox-fatigue-supplements/: • Crystal Star 
Adrenal Support, and Garden of Life B-12 Vitamin include “MONKEYPOX 
FATIGUE SUPPLEMENTS” in the product description and are listed under 
the “MONKEYPOX FATIGUE SUPPLEMENTS” category. Your Amazon associate products are 
not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for their 
above referenced uses for mpox and, therefore, these products are 
“new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 
U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs 
may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into 
interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in 
sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
331(d) and 355(a). Misbranded Human Drugs A drug is misbranded 
under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1) 
if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its 
intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which 
a layperson can use a drug safely and for the 
purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) 
Your Amazon associate products are offered to mitigate, prevent, treat, 
diagnose, or cure mpox, which is a condition that is 
not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment without the supervision of 
a licensed practitioner. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be 
written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely 
for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Amazon associate products fail 
to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, 
the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C 
Act. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce 
of misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 
21 U.S.C. 331(a). This letter is not meant to be 
an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with 
your products or operations. You are responsible for investigating and 
determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their 
recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your 
responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements 
of federal law, including FDA regulations. It is your responsibility 
to ensure that your activities, including as an Amazon associate, 
do not violate the FD&C Act. We advise you to 
review your websites and other labeling and promotional materials to 
ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your Amazon associate 
products as safe and effective for an mpox-related use for 
which they have not been approved by FDA and that 
you do not make claims that misbrand the products in 
violation of the FD&C Act. This letter notifies you of 
our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. 
Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal 
action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. Please notify FDA 
in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this 
letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address 
these matters. Include an explanation of each step being taken 
to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies 
of related documentation. If you believe that your Amazon associate 
products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include 
your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If 
you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state 
the reason for the delay and the time within which 
you will complete the correction. Please direct any inquiries to

1, 2022 Re: CMS # 630772 


Dear Mr. Sleman, On 
February 14, 2022, through February 16, 2022, the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) 
inspection of S&S Quality Wholesale Inc. located at 1200 Billy 
Mitchell Dr. Ste. E, El Cajon, CA 92020-1135. We also 
conducted an inspection on April 16, 2020. These inspections were 
conducted to determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 
of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) 
(21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 
CFR part 1 subpart L. The FSVP regulation requires that 
importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or 
animal food they import into the United States has been 
produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety 
standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP regulation 
and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links 
in FDA’s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals. During the most 
recent inspection, we found that you are not in compliance 
with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart L 
for the food products you import. Because of these significant 
violations, you are not in compliance with section 805 of 
the FD&C Act. At the conclusion of the inspection, our 
investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483a, FSVP Observations. 
We have not received your response to the Form FDA 
483a issued on February 16, 2022. Your significant violations of 
the FSVP regulation are as follows: You did not develop, 
maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by section 805 
of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 1.502(a). Specifically, 
you did not develop an FSVP for any of the 
foods you import, including: The above violations are not intended 
to be an all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP 
requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are 
in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act and 
the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 1 subpart L. 
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you 
an opportunity to address them. If you do not adequately 
address this matter, we may take further action. For instance, 
we may take action under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the foods 
you import for which you appear to be in violation 
of section 805. We may place the foods you import 
into the United States on detention without physical examination (DWPE) 
when you import the foods. You can find DWPE information 
relating to FSVP in Import Alert #99-41 at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In 
addition, the importation or offering for importation into the United 
States of an article of food without the importer having 
an FSVP that meets the requirements of section 805 of 
the FD&C Act or the FSVP regulation is prohibited under 
section 301(zz) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(zz)). You 
should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from 
your receipt of this letter. Your response should address the 
specific things you are doing to correct any violations. You 
should include in your response documentation and information that would 
assist us in evaluating your corrections (e.g., documentation of changes 
you made, such as a copy of your FSVP, records 
to demonstrate implementation of your FSVP), and any additional information 
that you wish to supply relevant to your compliance with 
the FSVP regulation. If you believe that you are not 
in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and 
any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete 
all corrections within 15 working days, you should explain the 
reason for your delay and state when you will correct 
any remaining violations. Please send your reply to the Food 
and Drug Administration, Attention: CDR Toby H. Hill, Compliance Officer, 
Division of Southwest Imports, One Main Place, 1201 Main Street,

LETTER The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed the website https://www.vaporlax.com and 
determined that electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) products listed there 
are manufactured and offered for sale or distribution to customers 
in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 
321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made 
or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain 
tobacco products, including ENDS, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under 
section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) 
and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1. Therefore, ENDS are required to 
be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act. 
Please be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed 
additional products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except 
accessories to these newly deemed products, to be subject to 
regulation under the FD&C Act. These products include, but are 
not limited to, ENDS (including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and 
pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be 
Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as 
Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; 
Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and 
Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 
(May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. Generally, to be legally 
marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new 
tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization order in effect. 
A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was 
not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 
15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially 
marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C 
Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order 
under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) 
the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 
905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and 
FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to 
a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) 
or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all 
modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial 
equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)). New Tobacco Products Without Required 
Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded Our review of the 
website https://www.vaporlax.com revealed that you manufacture and offer for sale 
or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS products 
without a marketing authorization order, including: Cool Mint by Vaporlax, 
Mango Ice by Vaporlax, Rainbow Mix by Sirius (Vaporlax), and 
Lemon Bar by Sirius (Vaporlax). The ENDS products listed above 
are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed 
in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These 
products do not have an FDA marketing authorization order in 
effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are 
not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these 
products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act. 
In addition, these products are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of 
the FD&C Act because a notice or other information respecting 
these products were not provided as required by section 905(j) 
of the FD&C Act. Conclusion and Requested Actions FDA has 
not received an application from your firm requesting marketing authorization 
for the products listed in this warning letter. FDA received 
your Premarket Tobacco Product Applications (PMTAs) assigned PMTA STN PM0002026 
on September 9, 2020 which covers 2 products, and STNs 
PM0005361, PM0005363, and PM0005365 on March 12, 2022, which cover 
165 products, but do not include the new tobacco products 
listed in this Warning Letter. Your firm continues to manufacture 
and/or offer for sale or distribution to consumers in the 
United States new tobacco products, including those listed in this 
Warning Letter, that are not included in your firm’s PMTAs 
and lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the 
market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully 
and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. The 
violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an 
exhaustive list. You should address any violations that are referenced 
above, as well as violations that are the same as 
or similar to those stated above, and promptly take any 
necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with 
the FD&C Act. It is your responsibility to ensure that 
your tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on 
this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, 
or search engine websites), in any other media in which 
you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each 
applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. 
Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 
U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco 
products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 
1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but 
not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, 
this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes 
of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that 
tobacco products offered for import into the United States that 
appear to be adulterated or misbranded may be detained or 
refused admission. Please submit a written response to this letter 
within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing 
your actions to address any violations and bring your products 
into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the 
violative labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products 
and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. 
If you believe that your products are not in violation 
of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting 
information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of our 
findings and provides you with an opportunity to address them. 
You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s

United States United States January 24, 2023 WARNING LETTER 635400 
In reply, refer to CMS 635400 


Dear Mr. Michael T. 
Shields and Ms. Windy N. Shields: This is to advise 
you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
conducted an inspection of your facility located at 2215 E 
Germann Rd, Chandler, Arizona, from April 11 through April 27, 
2022. Based on the inspectional findings we have identified serious 
violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the 
Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and 
FDA regulations through links in FDA's home page at www.fda.gov. 
The inspection of your facility revealed serious violations of FDA’s 
regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, 
Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements under Title 21, 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 
111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be 
adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act 
[21 United States Code (U.S.C.) § 342(g)(1)] because they have 
been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not 
meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. In addition, the (b)(4) 
brand (b)(4) and (b)(4) brand (b)(4) (in (b)(4) and (b)(4) 
sizes) dietary supplement products that you manufacture are misbranded within 
the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 
§ 343]. FDA acknowledges the receipt of your e-mail correspondence 
dated May 20, 2022 and June 23, 2022, written in 
response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to 
you at the close of the inspection. Not all of 
the items on the issued Form FDA 483 were addressed 
in your response. We address your response below, in relation 
to the applicable violations to which you responded. Dietary Supplement 
CGMP Violations Your significant violations of CGMP requirements are as 
follows: 1. You failed to establish an identity specification for 
your (b)(4) used in the manufacture of the (b)(4) brand 
(b)(4) product. Your raw material data sheet for (b)(4) states 
“(b)(4) Potency” as the specification for identity, but this does 
not establish standards to confirm the identity of the component 
used in the manufacture of your (b)(4) brand (b)(4) product, 
as required in 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). Additionally, your raw material 
data sheet for (b)(4) used in the manufacture of the 
(b)(4) brand (b)(4) product has five minerals in the blend 
but your purported ICP-MS specification for identity lists “mineral detected” 
as the specification and fails to establish standards which can 
be used to confirm the identity of the (b)(4) component, 
as required in 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). 2. You failed to 
establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications 
for the purity and composition of the dietary supplement manufactured 
using the components are met, as required in 21 CFR 
111.70(b)(2). For example, you have not established specifications for the 
(b)(4) Premix used in the manufacture of the (b)(4) brand 
(b)(4) product and specifications for several of the components used 
in the manufacture of the (b)(4) brand (b)(4) product to 
ensure that specifications for purity and composition of these products 
are met. We have reviewed your June 23, 2022 response 
to the form FDA 483. We are unable to evaluate 
the adequacy of your response because you did not provide 
documentation demonstrating you have established specifications in accordance with 21 
CFR 111.70(b)(1) and 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). You provide documents you 
describe as revised finished product specifications for the (b)(4) brand 
(b)(4) product and (b)(4) brand (b)(4) product. We note that 
these documents do not demonstrate that you have established specifications 
that provide standards to confirm the identity, purity, strength, and 
composition of the finished batch of your dietary supplements. For 
example, the finished product specification for (b)(4) brand (b)(4) product 
lists an “identification” specification of “Conforms to Standard” with a 
test method of “Eurofins or eq.” and a frequency of 
“Rotational.” “Conforms to standard” does not specify the extent to 
which the component must conform. “Eurofins or eq.” is not 
a test method and “Rotational” does not describe the frequency 
of when testing is to occur. Similarly, the finished product 
specification for your (b)(4) brand (b)(4) product states testing “Frequency” 
as “Rotation” for several components, and does not describe the 
frequency of when testing is to occur. 3. You failed 
to establish and follow laboratory control processes that are reviewed 
and approved by quality control personnel, for use of criteria 
for selecting standard reference materials used in performing tests and 
examinations, as required by 21 CFR 111.315(d). Specifically, the FTIR 
analysis performed by your third-party laboratory uses previous shipments of 
components as the reference for testing and they do not 
own a reference library for the FTIR tests. Testing components 
against previous shipments of the component may confirm receipt of 
the same component but this does not ensure the identity, 
purity, quality, and strength of the component is thoroughly characterized 
. 4. Your quality control operations did not approve and 
release, or reject, each finished batch for distribution as required 
by 21 CFR 111.123(a)(8). Specifically, your firm distributed (b)(4) brand 
(b)(4) product, Lot # (b)(4), without quality control review, approval 
and release of the finished batch for distribution. 5. Your 
quality control personnel must not approve and release for distribution 
any batch of dietary supplement, including any reprocessed batch, that 
does not meet all product specifications established in accordance with 
21 CFR 111.70(e), as required by 21 CFR 111.123(b)(2). Your 
quality control personnel released (b)(4) brand (b)(4), Lot # (b)(4), 
when the specification for pH was not met. Specifically, your 
established finished product specification for pH for the (b)(4) brand 
(b)(4) product is (b)(4) and the pH of the product 
in Lot # (b)(4) released for distribution was 6.34. 6. 
Your quality control personnel neither rejected a component or dietary 
supplement when that component or dietary supplement failed to meet 
a specification established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70, nor 
did they approve a treatment, an in-process adjustment, or reprocessing, 
as permitted in 21 CFR 111.77, in accordance with 21 
CFR 111.113(b)(2). Specifically, (b)(4) brand (b)(4), Lot # (b)(4), uses 
(b)(4) and (b)(4) as components. Testing of these two components 
by a third-party laboratory found both were not within your 
established specifications. Your quality control personnel failed to reject these 
components used in the manufacturing of your finished product and 
failed to reject the (b)(4) brand (b)(4) product, Lot # 
(b)(4). 7. Your quality control operations failed to approve, and 
release from quarantine, all components, before they are used as 
required by 21 CFR 111.120(e). Specifically, your quality control operations 
approved, and released from quarantine several components used in the 
manufacture of (b)(4) brand (b)(4) product, Lot # (b)(4), and 
components used in the manufacture of (b)(4) brand (b)(4), Lot 
# (b)(4). For example, the raw material data sheets for 
the components (b)(4), and (b)(4) used in the manufacture of 
your (b)(4) brand (b)(4), Lot # (b)(4), and the raw 
material data sheets for the (b)(4) and the (b)(4) used 
in the manufacture of your (b)(4) brand (b)(4) product, Lot 
# (b)(4) do not show a disposition by your quality 
control operations to approve, and release these components for use 
in manufacturing your finished products. 8. You failed to prepare 
and follow a master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique 
formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each 
batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from 
batch to batch, which includes all required information, as required 
by 21 CFR 111.205(a) and 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, the 
Master Manufacturing Records for the following (b)(4) brand products which 
you manufacture were missing the following required elements: a. (b)(4) 
Item # (b)(4): i. A statement of theoretical yield of 
a manufactured dietary supplement expected at each point, step, or 
stage of the manufacturing process and the maximum and minimum 
percentages of theoretical yield beyond which a deviation investigation of 
a batch is necessary. (21 CFR 111.210(f)). ii. Procedures for 
sampling and a cross-reference to procedures for tests or examinations. 
(21 CFR 111.210(h)(2)). b. (b)(4) Item # (b)(4): i. A 
statement of theoretical yield of a manufactured dietary supplement expected 
at each point, step, or stage of the manufacturing process 
and the maximum and minimum percentages of theoretical yield beyond 
which a deviation investigation of a batch is necessary. (21 
CFR 111.210(f)). ii. Procedures for sampling and a cross-reference to 
procedures for tests or examinations. (21 CFR 111.210(h)(2)). Misbrand Dietary 
Supplements 1. Your (b)(4) brand (b)(4) and (b)(4) brand (b)(4) 
and (b)(4) sizes) products are misbranded within the meaning of 
section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 343 (q)(5)(F)) in 
that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling 
of your product does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. 
For example, a. Your (b)(4) brand (b)(4) ((b)(4)) includes a 
Supplement Facts label with columns for “Amount per Serving (29.6 
mL),” “Ages 4+ yrs,” “Pregnant and Lactating,” “Per serving (2.5 
mL),” and “Ages 2-3 yrs.” Your “Suggested Use” panel includes 
different serving instructions for “2-3 Years,” “4-10 Years,” “11-17 Years,” 
“18 Years+,” and “Pregnant/Lactating & Seniors (65+).” Therefore, your Supplement 
Facts label fails to list all of the groups of 
individuals, by age or status (Pregnant/Lactating). for which the products 
are intended. b. Your (b)(4) brand (b)(4) ((b)(4)) includes a 
Supplement Facts label with columns for “Amount per Serving” and 
“% DV” for unspecified intended consumers; however, your “Suggested Use” 
panel lists several intended consumers, including “children, 1-3 years,” “Children, 
4-13 years,” “Adults, 14-64 years” (the serving size indicated on 
the Supplement Facts label), and “Pregnant/Lactating and Seniors, 65+.” Therefore, 
your Supplement Facts label fails to list all of the 
groups of individuals, by age or status (Pregnant/Lactating), for which 
the products are intended. c. Your (b)(4) brand (b)(4) ((b)(4)) 
product labels use the incorrect unit of measurement for copper 
for the (b)(4) serving size. The amount must use the 
unit of measurement given in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), as required 
by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B). 2. Your (b)(4) brand (b)(4) ((b)(4) 
and (b)(4)) and (b)(4) brand (b)(4) ((b)(4) and (b)(4) sizes) 
products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of 
the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size 
declared on the label is incorrect. Specifically, your product labels 
only list the serving size for one of the intended 
consumer groups listed in the “Suggested Use” panel. As your 
products are intended for several other age groups/categories of individual 
(Pregnant/Lactating or Senior), you must list the serving size for 
each group/category in your Supplement Facts label. 3. Your (b)(4) 
brand (b)(4) ((b)(4)) and (b)(4) brand (b)(4) ((b)(4) and (b)(4)) 
products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(B) of 
the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(B)] because the number of 
servings per container declared on the label is incorrect. Specifically, 
your product labels only list the number of servings for 
one of the intended consumer groups listed in the “Suggested 
Use” panel. As your products are intended for several other 
age groups/categories of individuals, you must list the number of 
servings for each group/category in your Supplement Facts label. 4. 
Your (b)(4) brand (b)(4) ((b)(4)) are misbranded within the meaning 
of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] 
in that the product label fails to declare the common 
or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 
21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically, the label 
declares trace minerals as part of the proprietary blend, but 
this is not the common or usual name of a 
dietary ingredient. This letter is not intended to be an 
all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with 
your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the 
causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or 
the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to 
ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal 
law, including FDA regulations. This letter notifies you of our 
concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure 
to adequately address this matter may result in legal action 
including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction. We also have the 
following comment: Based on further review of your product and 
process information, your firm’s “(b)(4)” products appear to meet the 
definition of an acidified food (AF) and your firm’s “(b)(4)” 
products appear to meet the definition of a low-acid canned 
food (LACF) as defined in 21 CFR Parts 108, 113 
and 114. Consequently, your firm may be required to register 
as an LACF/AF processor and file the necessary scheduled processes 
with FDA. We recommend working with a process authority to 
further evaluate your products in order to establish and file 
scheduled processes in accordance with 21 CFR Part 108. Please 
notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt 
of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken 
to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step 
being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well 
as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective 
actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the 
delay and the time within which you will do so. 
If you believe that your products are not in violation 
of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information 
for our consideration. Your written response should be sent to 
the following address: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, DFC Bldg

Dear 
Ms. Wiegert: This is to advise you that the United 
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at 
the Internet address https://organicheirloomplants.com in October 2022. We also reviewed 
your promotional literature that accompanies your products and your social 
media website at https://facebook.com/godgivenherbalremedies, where you direct consumers to your 
website, https://organicheirloomplants.com, to purchase your products Sarracenia Purpurea, Breathe Rite 
H2O2 Therapy, Ivermectwin, Nature’s Ancer, Zeolite, and Chaga Mushroom. Based 
on our review, the claims on your websites and promotional 
literature establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) 
[21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in 
the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Based on 
our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in 
violation of section 505(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 
355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 
of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. As explained further 
below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate 
commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find 
the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home 
page at www.fda.gov. The Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) has determined that a public health emergency exists nationwide 
involving mpox.1,2 Therefore, FDA is taking measures to protect customers 
from products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim 
to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure mpox. As described 
below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, 
treat, diagnose, or cure mpox in people. We request that 
you cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products 
for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of mpox. 
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence 
that your products are intended for use as a drug 
include the following: Sarracenia Purpurea On the product webpage for

certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be 
legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without 
prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 
505(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). FDA approves a 
new drug on the basis of scientific data and information 
demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. A drug 
is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 
352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for 
its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under 
which a layperson can use a drug safely and for 
the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). 
Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act 
[21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the 
direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Your 
Sarracenia Purpurea, Breathe Rite H2O2 Therapy, Nature’s Ancer, Ivermectwin, Zeolite, 
and Chaga Mushroom products are intended for treatment of one 
or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or 
treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it 
is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to 
use your product safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your 
Sarracenia Purpurea, Breathe Rite H2O2 Therapy, Nature’s Ancer, Ivermectwin, Zeolite, 
and Chaga Mushroom products fail to bear adequate directions for 
their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under 
section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction 
or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded 
drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)]. 
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement 
of violations that may exist in connection with your products. 
You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of 
any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence 
of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that 
your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including 
FDA regulations. This letter notifies you of our concerns and 
provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately 
address this matter may result in legal action including, without 
limitation, seizure and injunction. Within fifteen working days of receipt 
of this letter, please notify this office in writing of 
the specific steps you have taken to address these matters. 
Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent 
the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related 
documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working 
days, state the reason for the delay and the time 
within which you will complete the correction. If you believe 
that your product is not in violation of the Act,

Dear Ms. Mayer: This is to advise you that 
the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your 
website at the Internet address www.drgreenmom.com in October 2022 and 
has determined that you take orders there for your Vitamin 
A, Vitamin D, Liquid Zinc, Immunity Boost, Mother’s Immunity, and 
Colloidal Silver 15ppm products. Based on our review, the claims 
on your website establishes that these products are drugs under 
section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for 
use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. 
Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs 
sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Act, 21 
U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under 
section 502 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. As 
explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction 
into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You 
can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on 
FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. The Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) has determined that a public health emergency 
exists nationwide involving mpox.1,2 Therefore, FDA is taking measures to 
protect customers from products that, without approval or authorization by 
FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure mpox. 
As described below, you sell products that are intended to 
mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure mpox in people. We 
request that you cease the sale of any unapproved and 
unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure 
of mpox. Examples of some of the website claims that 
provide evidence that your product is intended for use as 
a drug include the following: From a May 23, 2022 
blog post entitled, “What is Monkeypox,” http://www.drgreenmom.com/what-is-monkeypox/: From a blog 
post entitled, “Colloidal Silver: Everything Parents Need to Know”: http://www.drgreenmom.com/colloidal-silver-everything-parents-need-to-know/: 
On the product webpage for “Vitamin D3 (400IU)”: http://www.drgreenmom.com/shop/vitamin-d3/ In 
addition, FDA is particularly concerned that your market your Colloidal 
Silver product for use in infants and children. For example, 
your blog post “Colloidal Silver: Everything Parents Need to Know” 
states that “Dr. Green Mom Colloidal Silver tastes like water 
and is easy to give to even the pickiest kids.” 
Your products have not been evaluated by FDA for safety, 
effectiveness, and quality. The use of untested drugs can have 
unpredictable and unintended consequences, especially in vulnerable populations such as 
children and infants who may be at greater risk for 
adverse reactions associated with certain drug products due to differences 
in the ability of children to absorb, metabolize, distribute, or 
excrete such drug products or their metabolites. Your Vitamin A, 
Vitamin D, Liquid Zinc, Immunity Boost, Mother’s Immunity, and Colloidal 
Silver 15ppm products are not generally recognized as safe and 
effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products 
are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act, 21 
U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs 
may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into 
interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in 
sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). 
FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific 
data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and 
effective. A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the 
Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear 
adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” 
means directions under which a layperson can use a drug 
safely and for the purposes for which it is intended 
(21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) 
of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used 
safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a 
licensed practitioner. Your Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Liquid Zinc, Immunity 
Boost, Mother’s Immunity, and Colloidal Silver 15ppm products are intended 
for treatment of one or more diseases that are not 
amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a 
licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions 
for a layperson to use your product safely for their 
intended purposes. Accordingly, your Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Liquid Zinc, 
Immunity Boost, Mother’s Immunity, and Colloidal Silver 15ppm products fail 
to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, 
the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act 
[21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into

United States United States December 7, 2022 WARNING LETTER Re: 
CMS # 643593 


Dear Mr. Sanchez: On August 11th and 
19th, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a 
Foreign Supplier Verification Programs (FSVP) inspection of SAN-REY PRODUCE INC, 
located at, 10101 S. Keystone Dr. in Pharr, Texas. We 
also conducted an inspection on November 13, 2020. These inspections 
were conducted to determine compliance with the requirements of section 
805 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C 
Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 
21 CFR part 1, subpart L. The FSVP regulation requires 
that importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human 
and/or animal food they import into the United States has 
been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food 
safety standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP 
regulation and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through 
links in FDA’s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals. During the 
most recent inspection, we found that you are not in 
compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart 
L for the foods you import. Because of these significant 
violations, you are not in compliance with section 805 of 
the FD&C Act. At the conclusion of the inspection, our 
investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483a, FSVP Observations 
(483a). We acknowledge receipt of your response, dated September 6, 
2022, to the 483a, including your stated intent to work 
with a consultant to address our concerns. We are unable 
to fully evaluate your response because you did not provide 
any supporting documentation or describe specific steps or FSVP activities 
you have taken to comply with the FSVP regulation. Your 
significant violations of the FSVP regulation are as follows: You 
did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP as required 
by section 805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 
1.502(a). Specifically, you did not develop an FSVP for any 
of the foods you import, including: You import fresh produce, 
that is “covered produce” as defined in 21 CFR 112.3. 
As an importer of covered produce, you must have an 
FSVP that demonstrates that your supplier is producing the food 
in compliance with processes and procedures that provide at least 
the same level of public health protection as those required 
under section 419 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
350h) (regarding standards for produce safety) and the implementing regulations 
in the Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding 
of Produce for Human Consumption (21 CFR part 112). The 
above violations are not intended to be an all-inclusive list 
of violations of the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility 
to ensure that you are in compliance with section 805 
of the FD&C Act and the implementing regulation in 21 
CFR part 1, subpart L. This letter notifies you of 
our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. 
If you do not adequately address this matter, we may 
take further action. For instance, we may take action under 
section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to 
refuse admission of the food you import for which you 
appear to be in violation of section 805. We may 
place the foods you import into the United States on 
detention without physical examination (DWPE) when you import the foods. 
You can find DWPE information relating to FSVP in Import 
Alert # 99-41, at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or 
offering for importation into the United States of an article 
of food without the importer having an FSVP that meets 
the requirements of section 805 of the FD&C Act or 
the FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(zz)). You should respond in writing 
within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this 
letter. Your response should address the specific things you are 
doing to correct any violations. You should include in your 
response documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating 
your corrections, (e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as 
a copy of your FSVP, records to demonstrate implementation of 
your FSVP), and any additional information that you wish to 
supply relevant to your compliance with the FSVP regulation. If 
you believe that you are not in violation of the 
FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for 
our consideration. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 
working days, you should explain the reason for your delay 
and state when you will correct any remaining violations. (b)(3)(A) 
As a responsible official of a facility that manufactures/processes, packs, 
or holds food for human or animal consumption in the 
United States, you are responsible for ensuring that your overall 
operation and the products you distribute are in compliance with 
the law. We request that the owner, operator, or agent 
in charge of this facility, or an individual authorized by 
this facility’s owner, operator, or agent in charge, register the 
facility with FDA within 30 working days of date of 
this letter. Food facility registration guidance is available online at 
https://www.fda.gov/food/guidance-regulation-food-and-dietary-supplements/registration-food-facilities-and-other-submissions. Registration may be accomplished online at http://www.access.fda.gov. You must 
submit your registration or registration renewal to FDA electronically, unless 
FDA has granted you a waiver under 21 CFR 1.245 
(21 CFR 1.231(a)(4)). Please send your reply to Food and 
Drug Administration, Attention: Virginia Ramos, Compliance Officer, the Division of 
Southwest Imports, 216 W. Village Blvd., Suite 107, Laredo, Texas 
78041. If you have any questions regarding this letter, you 
may contact Virginia Ramos via email at Virginia.Ramos@fda.hhs.gov. Please reference

Express Highway Goregaon East Mumbai 400063 Maharashtra India United States 
Warning Letter 320-23-08 December 15, 2022 


Dear Mr. Shanghvi: The 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your drug manufacturing 
facility, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., FEI 3002809586, at Halol-Baroda Highway, 
Dist. Panchmahal, Halol 389350, Gujrat, India, from April 26 to 
May 9, 2022. This warning letter summarizes significant violations of 
Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See 
Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 
211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211). Because your methods, 
facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do 
not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within 
the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). Additionally, your 
(b)(4) capsules, (b)(4) mg, USP are adulterated under section 501(b) 
of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(b) for failure to 
conform to compendial standards for strength, quality, or purity. We 
reviewed your May 31, 2022, response to our Form FDA 
483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence. 
CGMP Violations During our inspection, our investigators observed specific violations 
including, but not limited to, the following. 1. Your firm 
failed to establish and follow appropriate written procedures that are 
designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to 
be sterile, and that include validation of all aseptic and 
sterilization processes (21 CFR 211.113(b)). Inadequate Media Fills Your media 
fills failed to accurately simulate commercial operations. Our inspection found 
the aseptic operations simulated during your media fills were not 
sufficiently representative of commercial aseptic manufacturing operations for medroxyprogesterone acetate 
injectable suspension USP, 150 mg/mL, 1 ml prefilled syringes and 
vials. For example, data from the inspection indicated: A. Personnel 
simulated the manual addition of approximately (b)(4) grams of sterile 
(b)(4) to the compounding tank for up to (b)(4). However, 
for commercial manufacturing, approximately (b)(4) grams of sterile active pharmaceutical 
ingredient (API) was added to the compounding tank. This hand 
(b)(4) operation took up to (b)(4) and included a (b)(4) 
change during routine commercial manufacturing. B. Approximately (b)(4) grams of 
sterile (b)(4) was hand-(b)(4) from (b)(4) sealed (b)(4) container into 
(b)(4) or more canisters. This process was not consistent with 
commercial manufacturing, where approximately (b)(4) grams of sterile API was 
hand-(b)(4) from (b)(4) different (b)(4) pouches into (b)(4) canisters. Pouches 
used in commercial manufacturing may also have been previously opened 
and re-sealed. The dispensing and compounding steps were high-risk steps, 
and there were no additional sterilization steps following these operations. 
Your operators performed lengthy, highly manually intensive aseptic operations. As 
such, the duration of process simulation should closely resemble the 
actual manufacturing process. If a media fill program fails to 
incorporate contamination risk factors and closely simulate actual drug product 
exposure, the state of process control and sterility assurance cannot 
be accurately assessed. Poor Aseptic Behavior Media fill and smoke 
studies of your manually intensive aseptic operations, such as dispensing 
of sterile API, and addition of sterile API to the 
compounding tank, revealed poor aseptic techniques by your operators. Examples 
include, but are not limited to: Your response is inadequate. 
You experienced a significant media fill failure in November 2021, 
which revealed serious flaws and risks in your operation. You 
failed to perform a timely risk assessment to evaluate if 
the quality and sterility of your distributed drug products were 
affected by these deficiencies. You waited over five months to 
initiate a recall of the affected batches. The failure to 
proactively identify deficiencies and implement timely and sustainable corrective actions 
and preventive actions (CAPA) is unacceptable because it puts patients 
at risk. We acknowledge you discontinued medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension 
pre-filled syringe and vial manufacturing operations in Block (b)(4) as 
of November 30, 2021. This decision was based on the 
risks identified through your media fill failure investigation. You recalled 
all batches of the drug product following the FDA inspection. 
We also acknowledge that you intend to move the manufacturing 
operations to a new block equipped with (b)(4). See FDA’s 
guidance document Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing - 
Current Good Manufacturing Practice to help you meet the CGMP 
requirements when manufacturing sterile drugs using aseptic processing, at https://www.fda.gov/media/71026/download. 
In response to this letter, provide the following: 2. Your 
firm failed to perform operations within specifically defined areas of 
adequate size and to have separate or defined areas or 
such other control systems necessary to prevent contamination or mix-ups 
in aseptic processing areas (21 CFR 211.42(c)(10)). Cleanroom Design Your 
ISO 5 cleanroom areas used for aseptic compounding and filling 
were poorly designed and lacked adequate protection. For example, your 
ISO 5 area in Room (b)(4) lacked physical barriers to 
prevent potential contamination of your sterile components, including the sterile 
API, during manually intensive dispensing and compounding operations. Operators’ bodies 
and hands were in immediate proximity to the sterile API 
during dispensing, compounding, and syringe-loading in the filling station. Additionally, 
operators hand-(b)(4) sterile components into a compounding tank through a 
large funnel with a wide opening. Your smoke studies demonstrated 
non-unidirectional, recirculating airflow on and around the funnel. The ISO 
5 area is critical because sterile drug products are exposed 
and therefore vulnerable to contamination. Your aseptic manufacturing process should 
be designed and operations should be executed to minimize contamination 
hazards to your sterile drug product. Basic design deficiencies and 
manually intensive interventions in your operation undermine the ability to 
maintain asepsis. Environmental Monitoring You failed to establish an adequate 
system for monitoring environmental conditions. For example, you did not 
perform viable (surface and air) environmental monitoring in close proximity 
to aseptic dispensing operations in Room (b)(4). Likewise, no environmental 
monitoring was performed where sterile API was manually added to 
the compounding tank. Data reviewed during the inspection noted this 
aseptic operation lasted up to (b)(4). Your protocol failed to 
identify these locations as “high-risk” sampling points for environmental monitoring. 
Furthermore, personnel monitoring data was not captured appropriately. Vigilant and 
responsive environmental and personnel monitoring programs should be designed to 
provide meaningful information on the state of control of your 
aseptic processing environment. Operations that include highly manually intensive aseptic 
activities warrant a more extensive environmental and personnel monitoring program, 
including but not limited to emphasis on well-timed sampling that 
appropriately monitors batch manufacturing conditions. In your response you acknowledge 
the inadequacies of your environmental and personnel monitoring program. You 
state the drug products impacted by the observation are being 
recalled, and the specific filling line ((b)(4)) involved in the 
observation is no longer in use. You provide a high-level 
overview of an action plan with assurance to map the 
manufacturing process from a contamination prevention perspective. You fail to 
adequately explain how your quality and operations management will ensure 
appropriate cleanroom design, control, aseptic practices, and cleanroom behavior during 
production. In response to this letter, provide the following: • 
A comprehensive, independent risk assessment of all contamination hazards with 
respect to your aseptic processes, equipment, and facilities, including an 
independent assessment that includes, but is not limited to: o 
All human interactions within the ISO 5 area o Equipment 
placement and ergonomics o Air quality in the ISO 5 
area and surrounding room o Facility layout o Personnel Flows 
and Material Flows (throughout all rooms used to conduct and 
support sterile operations) Provide this comprehensive assessment for each of 
your aseptic operations. 3. Your firm failed to use equipment 
in the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of drug products 
that is of appropriate design, adequate size, and suitably located 
to facilitate operations for its intended use and for its 
cleaning and maintenance (21 CFR 211.63). You failed to identify 
and use equipment suitable for the filling of your viscous 
parenteral drug product. Inappropriately designed vial filling equipment led to 
substantial extraneous matter contamination in testosterone cypionate injection 200 mg/mL, 
1 ml vials. Further, your production department failed to establish 
adequate personnel practices and supervisory oversight to prevent the use 
of damaged equipment. You determined the design of the filling 
equipment ((b)(4)) in combination with the viscous nature of your 
drug product generated friction. This friction caused an abrasive effect 
on the surface of (b)(4) during (b)(4) movement which introduced 
blackish fine metallic particles into your vial during filling. You 
explained that these (b)(4) could not be fixed once damaged. 
Although reportedly removed from service, the damaged (b)(4) were listed 
as approved equipment in your master manufacturing batch record approved 
on April 5, 2022, approximately two years after they were 
identified as the root cause for cross-contamination. Notably, one of 
the damaged (b)(4) (H102) was used to fill numerous batches 
of testosterone cypionate injection. It is your responsibility to ensure 
that only appropriately designed and maintained equipment are used in 
the manufacture of your drug products. We acknowledge that after 
our inspection you voluntarily recalled five marketed testosterone cypionate injection 
lots associated with the (b)(4) investigations. Your response is inadequate. 
Your response fails to address the flaws in your change 
management system that permitted continued use of damaged and inappropriately 
designed (b)(4). Your response states that damaged (b)(4) were isolated 
and not used in filling testosterone cypionate injection but were 
inadvertently not removed from the manufacturing batch record. You also 
state that an associated (b)(4) (H102) was reconditioned and was 
acceptable for use. However, your firm indicated during the inspection 
that these damaged (b)(4) could not be reconditioned and acknowledged 
that they were not suitably designed. Your response also did 
not include a risk assessment that thoroughly evaluates the design 
and lifecycle control of manufacturing equipment including (b)(4) and (b)(4). 
In response to this letter, provide: 4. Your firm failed 
to thoroughly investigate any unexplained discrepancy or failure of a 
batch or any of its components to meet any of 
its specifications, whether or not the batch has already been 
distributed (21 CFR 211.192). Your investigations into water leaks in 
your cleanroom were inadequate because they lacked appropriate CAPA and 
failed to extend to other potentially affected batches. For example, 
water leaked from the service floor through the heating, ventilation, 
and air conditioning (HVAC) duct floor and into the ceiling 
directly above the ISO 5 filling area. Your investigation report 
noted water accumulated on the service floor due to a 
leak from an old, punctured (b)(4). Water then collected over 
the (b)(4) partition ceiling prior to entering the aseptic filling 
room where medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension USP, was manufactured. Your 
personnel confirmed there was substantial water accumulation on the service 
floor. Although you sealed gaps in the ceiling, you did 
not sufficiently inspect the service floor, (b)(4) LAF ceiling, and 
HVAC duct floor for mold growth and water damage after 
the repairs were made. You also failed to extend the 
scope of your investigation to potentially impacted batches of medroxyprogesterone 
acetate injectable suspension USP manufactured in this room since the 
last preventive maintenance of the (b)(4), approximately two months before 
the leak was observed. In your response, you state the 
leak was isolated to the day it was observed. You 
acknowledge that your investigation did not evaluate the impact of 
the leak to other batches. You initiated a recall on 
May 17, 2022, for all marketed batches of medroxyprogesterone acetate 
injectable suspension USP, 150 mg/mL, 1 mL vials manufactured on 
this line, for events unrelated to this investigation. Your response 
is inadequate. While we acknowledge you initiated actions to address 
this specific leak, your investigation failed to sufficiently address facility 
damage and the potential for microbial (i.e., particularly fungal) contamination 
that could persist in the facility due to water leaks 
and moisture. In response to this letter, provide a comprehensive, 
independent assessment of your overall system for investigating deviations, discrepancies, 
complaints, OOS results, and failures. Provide a detailed action plan 
to remediate this system. Your action plan should include, but 
not be limited to, significant improvements in investigation competencies, scope 
determination, root cause evaluation, CAPA effectiveness, quality assurance unit oversight, 
and written procedures. Address how your firm will ensure all 
phases of investigations are appropriately conducted. 5. Your firm failed 
to clean, maintain, and, as appropriate for the nature of 
the drug, sanitize and/or sterilize equipment and utensils at appropriate 
intervals to prevent malfunctions or contamination that would alter the 
safety, identity, strength, quality, or purity of the drug product 
beyond the official or other established requirements (21 CFR 211.67(a)). 
You failed to adequately clean and maintain your equipment used 
for drug product manufacturing. For example: A. Our investigators observed 
visible residue on (b)(4) 1 after it was identified as 
clean. Also, colored particles and pellets were observed inside a 
crevice where the (b)(4) was attached to (b)(4) 1. During 
the inspection your analytical testing identified that the pellets contained 
(b)(4) API. The equipment cleaning record indicated a Type-B cleaning 
was performed on (b)(4) 1, which is defined as complete 
removal of previous drug product and involves dismantling of (b)(4). 
B. Our investigators observed numerous scratches and dents on product 
contact surfaces of the (b)(4) bowl-II. Additionally, shiny metal fragments 
were observed on the top of the (b)(4) gaskets that 
connected the (b)(4) in (b)(4) 4. Inadequately cleaned and maintained 
equipment can lead to cross contamination and poor quality drug 
products. Your response states that the (b)(4) was not disassembled 
during the cleaning process because engineering staff was not available. 
The residue and powder were from the previously manufactured drug 
product (which was the same drug). You also confirm the 
shiny fragments on the (b)(4) gaskets are (b)(4) and stated 
that the shedding of metal fragments most likely occurred during 
the assembly and disassembly process. You state that your protocol-based 
visual inspection of (b)(4) performed in response to this observation 
did not result in any similar findings. Your response is 
inadequate. You state that your impact assessment is ongoing, and 
the batches manufactured since the last campaign are on hold. 
However, you do not provide information on how long the 
damaged and inadequately cleaned equipment has been used. You also 
do not provide a risk assessment for drug products manufactured 
and distributed using such equipment. Your response fails to sufficiently 
address the confirmed complaints you received since January 2020 pertaining 
to stains, specks, and spots in your (b)(4) tablets, (b)(4) 
mg, and (b)(4) tablets (b)(4) mg drug products. In response 
to this letter, provide: • A comprehensive, independent retrospective assessment 
of your cleaning effectiveness to evaluate the scope of cross-contamination 
hazards. Include the identity of residues, other manufacturing equipment that 
may have been improperly cleaned, and an assessment whether cross-contaminated 
drug products may have been released for distribution. The assessment 
should identify any inadequacies of cleaning procedures and practices and 
encompass each piece of manufacturing equipment used to manufacture more 
than one drug product. • A CAPA plan, based on 
the retrospective assessment of your cleaning program, that includes appropriate 
remediations to your cleaning processes and practices, and timelines for 
completion. Provide a detailed summary of vulnerabilities in your process 
for lifecycle management of equipment cleaning. Describe improvements to your 
cleaning program, including enhancements to cleaning effectiveness; improved ongoing verification 
of proper cleaning execution for all products and equipment; and 
all other needed remediations. • An independent review of your 
investigations and complaints of foreign matter contamination in your products. 
The review should comprehensively assess your program, including but not 
limited to sources of foreign matter, risks associated with the 
product, and appropriate investigations and CAPA. • Your protocol to 
test any drug product, within expiry and manufactured on non-dedicated 
(b)(4) equipment, for contamination. • A comprehensive assessment and remediation 
plan to ensure your QU is given the authority and 
resources to effectively function. The assessment should also include, but 
not be limited to, evaluating: o whether procedures used by 
your firm are robust and appropriate o sufficiency of provisions 
used for QU oversight throughout your operations to evaluate adherence 
to appropriate practices o whether an effective and complete final 
review of each batch and its related information is conducted 
before the QU disposition decision o implementation of oversight and 
approval of investigations, as well as discharging of all other 
QU duties to ensure identity, strength, quality, and purity of 
all products Compendial Violations FDA collected a sample of (b)(4) 
capsules, (b)(4) mg, USP, lot number (b)(4) (expiration date: 01/2024), 
manufactured at Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Halol, that was offered 
for import into the U.S. Your (b)(4) drug product failed 
to meet specifications for dissolution. These results cause the drug 
product to be adulterated within the meaning of 501(b) of 
the Act, [21 U.S.C. 351(b)], in that its strength, quality, 
or purity failed to meet specifications set forth in an 
official compendium in which the drug product is represented. Ineffective 
Quality Systems Significant findings in this letter demonstrate that your 
firm does not operate an effective quality system in accordance 
with CGMP. In addition to the lack of effective oversight 
of production operations to ensure reliable facilities and equipment, we 
found your QU is insufficiently resourced or enabled with authority 
to carry out its responsibilities. Furthermore, internal communications and systems 
were not implemented by management to ensure all levels of 
the company can effectively identify major quality risks so they 
are promptly escalated to senior management, whenever needed. You should 
immediately and comprehensively assess your company’s global manufacturing operations to 
ensure that systems, processes, and the products manufactured conform to 
FDA requirements. The role of senior management leadership is critical 
to ensure successful functioning of a robust and effective quality 
system. See FDA’s guidance document Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical 
CGMP Regulations for help implementing quality systems and risk-management approaches 
to meet the requirements of CGMP regulations 21 CFR, parts 
210 and 211, at https://www.fda.gov/media/71023/download. CGMP Consultant Recommended Based upon 
the nature of the violations we identified at your firm, 
we strongly recommend engaging a consultant qualified as set forth 
in 21 CFR 211.34 to assist your firm in meeting 
CGMP requirements. Your use of a consultant does not relieve 
your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive 
management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws 
to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance. Conclusion The violations cited in 
this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list 
of violations that exist at your facility in connection with 
your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the 
causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or 
the occurrence of other violations. If you are considering an 
action that is likely to lead to a disruption in 
the supply of drugs produced at your facility, FDA requests 
that you contact CDER’s Drug Shortages Staff immediately, at drugshortages@fda.hhs.gov, 
so that FDA can work with you on the most 
effective way to bring your operations into compliance with the 
law. Contacting the Drug Shortages Staff also allows you to 
meet any obligations you may have to report discontinuances or 
interruptions in your drug manufacture under 21 U.S.C. 356C(b). This 
also allows FDA to consider, as soon as possible, what 
actions, if any, may be needed to avoid shortages and 
protect the health of patients who depend on your products. 
FDA placed your firm on Import Alert 66-40 on December 
7, 2022. Correct any violations promptly. FDA may withhold approval 
of new applications or supplements listing your firm as a 
drug manufacturer until any violations are completely addressed and we 
confirm your compliance with CGMP. We may re-inspect to verify 
that you have completed corrective actions to any violations. Failure 
to address any violations may also result in the FDA 
refusing admission of articles manufactured at Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, 
Halol, into the United States under section 801(a)(3) of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3). Articles under this authority that 
appear to be adulterated may be detained or refused admission, 
in that the methods and controls used in their manufacture 
do not appear to conform to CGMP within the meaning 
of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). 
This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you 
an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. After you receive 
this letter, respond to this office in writing within 15 
working days. Specify what you have done to address any 
violations and to prevent their recurrence. In response to this 
letter, you may provide additional information for our consideration as 
we continue to assess your activities and practices. If you 
cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state your 
reasons for delay and your schedule for completion. We request 
you email CDER-OC-OMQ-Communications@fda.hhs.gov, within five days of receipt of this 
letter to schedule a regulatory meeting. Send your electronic reply 
to CDER-OC-OMQ-Communications@fda.hhs.gov. Identify your response with FEI 3002809586 and ATTN:

FL 34758-1800 United States United States WARNING LETTER 23-HAFE4-WL-01/CMS No. 
637153 


Dear Mr. Persaud and Mr. Sew: The United States 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in conjunction with Florida Department 
of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) conducted an inspection of 
your facility, located at 1770 and 1780 Business Center Lane, 
Kissimmee, Florida from May 11, 2022 through May 31, 2022, 
where you re-pack and distribute milled rice products. During our 
inspection of your facility, FDA investigators found serious violations of 
the Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive 
Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP rule & PC rule), 
Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR 
Part 117). During the inspection, FDA collected filth samples from 
various areas within your warehouse facility, and the analytical results 
revealed rodent excreta pellets, multi-stage beetles (adult and larvae), fecal 
material that contained cat/dog hairs, and insects including flies and 
moths present throughout your facility. Additionally, FDA collected samples from 
your Florida Gold brand 2-lb bags of rice and performed 
a filth analysis which revealed various species of insects at 
larval, pupae and adult stages present in the sample. At 
the conclusion of the inspection, the FDA investigators issued a 
Form FDA 483 (FDA-483), Inspectional Observations, listing the deviations found 
at your firm. Based on inspectional and analytical findings, we 
determined that the food products packaged and/or held in your 
facility are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 
U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)] in that they have been prepared, packed, 
or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become 
contaminated with filth or whereby they may have been rendered 
injurious to health. You may find the Act and further 
information about the CGMP & PC rule through links on 
FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov. On May 12, 2022, based on 
the finding of the current inspection, FDACS placed all products 
in building (b)(4) and building (b)(4) under Stop Sale Order 
and your equipment under a Stop Use Order. On August 
26, 2022, in response to the current inspectional findings and 
under FDACS’s oversight, you completed your voluntary destruction of all 
products and packaging within both buildings. However, to date, we 
have not received your written response to the issued FDA-483 
describing corrective actions taken by your firm or changes you 
are making to your business operations. You informed our FDA 
investigators at the close of our inspection that your business 
plans to sell the facility and cease food manufacturing and 
storage. However, FDA’s import records reflect that on August 3, 
2022 and September 23, 2022, you received shipments of Parboiled 
Rice in which you were identified as the consignee and 
your current facility location was listed. To date, your facility 
website is still active. Further, it is our understanding that 
you have not filed the articles for dissolution of your 
LLC, and you have not canceled your food facility registration 
with FDA. We are issuing this letter to advise you 
of FDA’s concerns and to provide detailed information describing the 
findings at your facility. Current Good Manufacturing Practice (21 CFR 
Part 117 Subpart B) 1. You did not take effective 
measures to exclude pests from your packing and holding areas 
and to protect against the contamination of food on the 
premises by pests, as required by 21 CFR 117.35(c). Specifically, 
rodent, insect, and animal activity were observed throughout your facility 
including the following: a. Rodent Activity observed: i. In building 
(b)(4), investigators observed apparent rodent excreta pellets (too numerous to 
count) on top of bulk totes of milled rice intended 
to be reworked. At least 30 out of approximately (b)(4) 
of these bulk totes of milled rice for rework had 
openings or broken areas on top of the bag where 
the rice was exposed. Investigators observed apparent rodent excreta pellets 
(too numerous to count) on and inside processing equipment in 
building (b)(4); along the perimeter walls of buildings (b)(4) and 
building (b)(4); and between pallets of repacked bagged rice, totes 
of bulk rice, on empty cardboard boxes, on boxes with 
packaging material in buildings (b)(4) and building (b)(4); and on 
bags to be used as finished product packaging that are 
fabricated and labeled by the firm for use by other 
companies. ii. In building (b)(4), investigators observed at least five 
(5) live rodents throughout the processing and storage areas. Of 
the live rodents, two (2) rodents were observed under pallets 
of bulk rice to be reworked in the area adjacent 
to the processing equipment on the northern end of building 
(b)(4), and two (2) rodents were observed in the southern 
end of the building running around the perimeter of the 
facility and in between pallets containing bulk totes of rice. 
Investigators also observed an apparent newborn rodent lying in between 
50-lb bags of jasmine rice at the southern end of 
building (b)(4). iii. Investigators observed numerous areas with apparent fluorescing 
rodent urine stains located in the northwest corner of the 
building (b)(4) on the floor next to pallets of milled 
rice to be reworked and on the west side of 
building (b)(4) on pallets containing bulk totes of milled rice 
intended to be discarded and located within 2 feet of 
bulk totes of milled rice to be repacked or distributed. 
Apparent fluorescing rodent urine stains were also observed on the 
north side of building (b)(4) on old equipment to be 
used for parts, on unused cardboard boxes which store packing 
materials and miscellaneous items, and on packing materials such as 
bags or rice sacks. b. Insect activity observed: i. Throughout 
buildings (b)(4) and (b)(4), investigators observed dead and live insects 
(too numerous to count) such as apparent moths, beetles, weevils, 
and spiders, inside in-process product to be reworked, on and 
inside processing equipment such as the (b)(4) machine, two (2) 
(b)(4) machines, (b)(4) machines, and all equipment around both buildings 
to be used either in the milling process or being 
stored for parts. There were also apparent flies and gnats 
flying around inside and outside of the buildings. Additionally, cockroaches 
were observed in building (b)(4) on and around soiled pots 
and pans containing food residue in the employee shower room 
at the southern end of the building. c. Animal activity 
observed: i. In building (b)(4), investigators observed four (4) or 
more live cats in the northern end of the building 
and apparent cat feces and urine throughout the warehouse. ii. 
In building (b)(4), investigators observed one (1) rodent carcass near 
the packaging equipment on the eastern side of the building. 
iii. Investigators observed a cat running from building (b)(4) with 
a rodent in its mouth. d. Samples FDA analyzed several 
samples for filth which were collected during our inspection from 
various areas within your warehouse facility (samples 1167660, 1178228, and 
1182068) and a sample of your Florida Gold brand 2-lb 
bags of rice (sample 1180611). These samples were submitted to 
FDA labs for analysis. Results from the Florida Gold brand 
2-lb bags of rice demonstrate that this product was adulterated 
with various species of insects at larval, pupae and adult 
stages including multi-stage dead beetles, sawtoothed grain beetles, and red 
flour beetles. Further, the samples collected from within your facility 
resulted in numerous filth findings including the presence of rodent 
excreta pellets of a size implicating a rat, fecal material 
with internal cat/dog hairs, rat/mouse hairs, two (2) feathers identified 
as songbird feathers, multi-stage beetles (adult and larvae), and insects 
including but not limited to, flies and moths. The filth 
samples further demonstrate the presence of rodents and insect activity 
throughout the facility through the presence of rodent hairs and 
in pellet morphology as well as confirmation of various species 
of insects at larval, pupae and adult stages. 2. You 
did not maintain your plant in a clean and sanitary 
condition and keep your plant in repair adequate to prevent 
food from becoming adulterated, as required by 21 CFR 117.35(a). 
Insanitary conditions around your facility demonstrated that sanitation and housekeeping 
operations were inadequate because your facility provided food sources and 
pest harborage areas for rodents and other pests. In addition, 
inadequate maintenance of parts of the facility allowed for potential 
pest entry and harborage areas within the facility. a. In 
building (b)(4) investigators observed the following: i. Filth, debris, and 
pests were on and in milled rice processing equipment located 
on the (b)(4) of the building. ii. Numerous pieces of 
milled rice processing equipment were in disrepair with tape and 
peeling paint on food contact surfaces. iii. There were numerous 
holes and gaps on interior walls including a hole approximately 
(b)(4) on the wall near the packaging equipment on the 
east side of the building. iv. There were holes leading 
to the exterior of the facility, including a hole approximately 
(b)(4) at the top edge of the vent pipe in 
the processing equipment area in the northwest corner of the 
building. v. The (b)(4) door nearest the southwest corner of 
the building had a gap approximately (b)(4) inches high along 
the bottom of the door. b. In building (b)(4) investigators 
observed the following: i. Filth, debris, and pests were on 
and in non-functioning equipment located throughout the building that was 
being stored to be used for parts. ii. Bags of 
rice with live and dead insects that were intended to 
be thrown away were being stored alongside recently received milled 
rice. iii. Thousands of plastic screw-top containers that were intended 
to be discarded were being stored alongside recently received milled 
rice. We observed apparent rodent excreta pellets (too numerous to 
count, as described above) and other filth on and around 
the pallets of plastic containers. iv. Other miscellaneous items (e.g., 
personal items such as shoes, pots and pans, cigarette ends, 
a washing machine, detergents) were scattered throughout the building. v. 
The bay door nearest the southeast corner of the building 
had a gap approximately (b)(4) inches high along the bottom 
of the door. vi. There were two (2) open pipes 
emerging from the floor in the (b)(4) of the building 
that were surrounded by insects and apparent rodent excreta pellets. 
There were two (2) holes approximately (b)(4) on the interior 
wall within (b)(4) feet of the open pipes. Insulation was 
protruding from one of the holes in the wall. c. 
In the exterior areas around and between buildings (b)(4) and 
(b)(4), there were large numbers of pallets, piles of empty 
rice totes, piles of plastic screw-top containers, dumpsters overflowing with 
garbage, unused rice milling and packaging equipment, and numerous additional 
miscellaneous items (all too numerous to count). This inadequate maintenance 
presents the potential to attract pests and become harborage areas.

States United States DATE: 12/20/2022 Case #: 641808 WARNING LETTER 



Dear Mr. Koth: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
inspected your drug manufacturing facility, Auto-Chlor System LLC, FEI 3010164603, 
at 3045 Commerce Way, Hapeville, from July 5 to 18, 
2022. This warning letter summarizes significant violations of Current Good 
Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 21 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 
CFR parts 210 and 211). Because your methods, facilities, or 
controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform 
to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning 
of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). In addition, HAND KLEEN 
FOAMING INSTANT HAND SANITIZER is an unapproved new drug introduced 
or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of 
section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), and 
is misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act, 21 
U.S.C. 352(ee). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such product 
into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(d) and (a) 
of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and (a). These 
violations are described in more detail below. We reviewed your 
August 8, 2022, response to our Form FDA 483 in 
detail. Your response is inadequate because it did not provide 
sufficient detail or evidence of corrective actions to bring your 
operations into compliance with CGMP. During our inspection, our investigators 
observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following. 
1. Your firm failed to establish and follow written procedures 
for cleaning and maintenance of equipment (21 CFR 211.67(b)). Your 
firm is currently registered as a drug manufacturer and manufactures 
over-the-counter (OTC) hand rub1 drug products (also referred to as 
a consumer hand sanitizer) including HAND KLEEN FOAMING INSTANT HAND 
SANITIZER, as well as non-drug products including industrial cleaners. It 
is unacceptable as a matter of CGMP to continue manufacturing 
drugs using the same equipment that you use to manufacture 
industrial cleaners or other non-pharmaceutical products due to the risk 
of cross-contamination. Our investigator also observed inadequate cleaning and maintenance 
of your drug manufacturing equipment. Inadequate removal of active ingredients 
and drug product residues from surfaces of non-dedicated manufacturing equipment 
can lead to contamination of drug products subsequently manufactured on 
that equipment. 2. Your firm failed to test samples of 
each component for identity and conformity with all appropriate written 
specifications for purity, strength, and quality. Your firm also failed 
to validate and establish the reliability of your component supplier’s 
test analyses at appropriate intervals (21 CFR 211.84(d)(1) and 211.84(d)(2)). 
You failed to test your incoming components for identity before 
using the components to manufacture your drug products. This includes 
not testing incoming ethanol, used as an active ingredient, for 
methanol. Additionally, you relied on certificates of analyses from unqualified 
suppliers for specifications such as purity, strength, and quality. By 
not analyzing your components for identity, purity, strength, and quality, 
you failed to ensure that your incoming components meet appropriate 
specifications. In addition, you confirmed that your firm uses (b)(4) 
water as a component for manufacturing drug products. Your firm 
has not shown that the (b)(4) water that you use 
for component water is suitable for aqueous-based dosage form drug 
product manufacturing, and, at a minimum, meets the USP purified 
water monograph and appropriate microbial limits. You confirmed to our 
investigators that no testing of this (b)(4) water has been 
performed, and you also lack procedures regarding water specifications, testing, 
or handling of water. Furthermore, you manufacture drugs that contain 
ethanol. The use of ethanol contaminated with methanol has resulted 
in various lethal poisoning incidents in humans worldwide. See FDA’s 
guidance document Policy for Testing of Alcohol (Ethanol) and Isopropyl 
Alcohol for Methanol, Including During the Public Health Emergency (COVID-19) 
to help you meet the CGMP requirements when manufacturing drugs 
containing ethanol at https://www.fda.gov/media/145262/download. As a manufacturer, you have a 
responsibility to sample, test, and examine drug components before use 
to assure adequate quality, including testing for the presence of 
methanol in ethanol, before use in production. 3. Your firm 
failed to establish adequate written procedures for production and process 
control designed to assure that the drug products you manufacture 
have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they purport or 
are represented to possess (21 CFR 211.100(a)). Your firm has 
not established that your processes used to manufacture hand sanitizer 
drug products are validated. In addition, you could not provide 
evidence that equipment qualification had been performed on your equipment. 
Process validation evaluates the soundness of design and state of 
control of a process throughout its lifecycle. Each significant stage 
of a manufacturing process must be designed appropriately and assure 
the quality of raw material inputs, in-process materials, and finished 
drugs. Process qualification studies determine whether an initial state of 
control has been established. Successful process qualification studies are necessary 
before commercial distribution. Thereafter, ongoing vigilant oversight of process performance 
and product quality is necessary to ensure you maintain a 
stable manufacturing operation throughout the product lifecycle. See FDA’s guidance 
document Process Validation: General Principles and Practices for general principles 
and approaches that FDA considers appropriate elements of process validation 
at https://www.fda.gov/media/71021/download. 4. Your firm’s quality control unit failed to 
exercise its responsibility to ensure drug products manufactured are in 
compliance with CGMP, and meet established specifications for identity, strength, 
quality, and purity (21 CFR 211.22). Your quality unit (QU) 
did not provide adequate oversight for the manufacture of your 
drug products. For example, your QU failed to ensure the 
following: An adequate QU overseeing all manufacturing operations is necessary 
to consistently ensure drug quality. See FDA’s guidance document Quality 
Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP Regulations for help implementing quality 
systems and risk management approaches to meet the requirements of 
CGMP regulations 21 CFR, parts 210 and 211 at https://www.fda.gov/media/71023/download. 
Unapproved New Drug and Misbranding Violations Examples of claims observed 
on the HAND KLEEN FOAMING INSTANT HAND SANITIZER label that 
provide evidence of the intended uses2 (as defined in 21 
CFR 201.128) of the product include, but may not be 
limited to, the following: “HAND KLEEN FOAMING INSTANT HAND SANITIZER 
. . . Drug Facts . . . Active Ingredient 
. . . Benzethonium Chloride 0.20% w/w . . . 
Purpose . . . Antiseptic handwash. . . Uses . 
. . For handwashing to decrease bacteria on the skin. 
. . Directions . . . Apply a small amount 
to palm · Briskly rub, covering hands with product until 
dry. . .” [from your HAND KLEEN FOAMING INSTANT HAND 
SANITIZER label] This topical antiseptic product is a “new drug” 
within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 
21 U.S.C. 321(p), because it is not generally recognized as 
safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, 
recommended, or suggested in its labeling. New drugs may not 
be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without 
prior approval from FDA, as described in section 505(a) of 
the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), unless they are lawfully 
marketed under section 505G of the FD&C Act (which is 
not the case for this product, as further described below) 
or other exceptions not applicable here. No FDA-approved application pursuant 
to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, 
is in effect for this drug product, nor are we 
aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical studies in the 
published literature that support a determination that your HAND KLEEN 
FOAMING INSTANT HAND SANITIZER product is GRASE for use under 
the conditions suggested, recommended, or prescribed in its labeling. Accordingly, 
this product is an unapproved new drug marketed in violation 
of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 
U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d). We note that OTC topical antiseptic 
products had been the subject of rulemaking under the Agency’s 
OTC Drug Review. In particular, such products were addressed in 
a tentative final monograph (TFM) entitled “Topical Antimicrobial Drug Products 
for Over-the-Counter Human Use; Tentative Final Monograph for Health-Care Antiseptic 
Drug Products,” Proposed Rule, 59 FR 31402 (June 17, 1994) 
(1994 TFM), as further amended by “Safety and Effectiveness of 
Consumer Antiseptics; Topical Antimicrobial Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use; 
Proposed Amendment of the Tentative Final Monograph; Reopening of Administrative 
Record,” Proposed Rule, 81 FR 42912 (June 30, 2016) (Consumer 
Antiseptic Rubs Proposed Rule). Over the course of these rulemakings, 
three active ingredients (benzalkonium chloride, ethyl alcohol (ethanol), and isopropyl 
alcohol) were classified as Category III for use in consumer 
antiseptic rub products, meaning that additional safety and effectiveness data 
are needed to support a determination that a drug product 
containing one of these active ingredients would be GRASE for 
use as a consumer antiseptic rub. Additionally, OTC consumer antiseptic 
washes were addressed in “Safety and Effectiveness of Consumer Antiseptics; 
Topical Antimicrobial Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use,” Proposed Rule, 
78 FR 76444 (December 17, 2013) (Consumer Antiseptic Washes Proposed 
Rule) and “OTC Safety and Effectiveness of Topical Antimicrobial Drug 
Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use,” Final Rule, 81 FR 61106 
(September 6, 2016). We note that the active ingredient benzethonium 
chloride was classified as Category III for use as an 
active ingredient in a consumer antiseptic wash. However, benzethonium chloride 
was determined to be ineligible for evaluation under the OTC 
Drug Review for use as an active ingredient in consumer 
antiseptic rubs. Section 505G of the FD&C Act addresses nonprescription 
drugs marketed without an approved application. Under section 505G(a)(3) of 
the FD&C Act, drugs that were classified as Category III 
for safety or effectiveness in a TFM that is the 
most recently applicable proposal or determination for such drug issued 
under 21 CFR Part 330 – and that were not 
classified as Category II for safety or effectiveness – are 
not required to have an approved application under section 505 
in order to be marketed, as long as they are 
in conformity with the relevant conditions of use outlined in 
the applicable TFM, including the active ingredient, and comply with 
all other applicable requirements. However, HAND KLEEN FOAMING INSTANT HAND 
SANITIZER does not conform to the 1994 TFM, as further 
amended by the 2016 Consumer Antiseptic Rubs Proposed Rule [and 
the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Washes Proposed Rule], nor any other 
TFM, proposed rule, or final rule, and does not meet 
the conditions under section 505G(a)(3) of the FD&C Act for 
marketing without an approved application under section 505. As previously 
noted, statements on the product label for HAND KLEEN FOAMING 
INSTANT HAND SANITIZER suggest that this product is intended to 
be both a consumer antiseptic wash and consumer antiseptic rub. 
However, benzethonium chloride (in any concentration) is not an active 
ingredient permitted for use in consumer antiseptic rubs under the 
1994 TFM. A product cannot also be labeled as a 
handwash with directions in the labeling that pertain to use 
as a hand rub under the 1994 TFM. Lastly, this 
product is misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act, 
21 U.S.C. 352(ee), because HAND KLEEN FOAMING INSTANT HAND SANITIZER 
is a nonprescription drug subject to section 505G of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, but does not comply with 
the requirements for marketing under that section and is not 
the subject of an application approved under section 505 of 
the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355. CGMP Consultant Recommended Based 
upon the nature of the violations we identified at your 
firm, if your firm intends to resume manufacturing drugs for 
the U.S. market, you should engage a consultant qualified as 
set forth in 21 CFR 211.34 to assist your firm 
in meeting CGMP requirements. The qualified consultant should also perform 
a comprehensive audit of your entire operation for CGMP compliance 
and evaluates the completion and efficacy of any identified corrective 
actions and preventive actions before you pursue resolution of your 
firm’s compliance status with FDA. Outsourcing to Contract Manufacturers We 
acknowledge your commitment to cease production of drugs at this 
facility, to outsource the manufacturing of all FDA products to 
a private labeling company, and to ensure appropriate corrections are 
completed at the new manufacturer. If you plan to resume 
or outsource the manufacturing of drugs, notify this office before 
resuming your operations. Drugs must be manufactured in conformance with 
CGMP. FDA is aware that many drug manufacturers use independent 
contractors such as production facilities, testing laboratories, packagers, and labelers. 
FDA regards contractors as extensions of the manufacturer. You are 
responsible for the quality of your drugs regardless of agreements 
in place with your contract facility. You are required to 
ensure that drugs are made in accordance with section 501(a)(2)(B) 
of the FD&C Act to ensure safety, identity, strength, quality, 
and purity. See FDA’s guidance document Contract Manufacturing Arrangements for 
Drugs: Quality Agreements at https://www.fda.gov/media/86193/download. Conclusion The violations cited in 
this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list 
of violations that exist at your facility. You are responsible 
for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and 
for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. 
Correct any violations promptly. Failure to promptly and adequately address 
this matter may result in regulatory or legal action without 
further notice including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction. Unresolved violations 
may also prevent other Federal agencies from awarding contracts. Failure 
to address violations may also cause FDA to withhold issuance 
of Export Certificates. FDA may withhold approval of new applications 
or supplements listing your firm as a drug manufacturer until 
any violations are completely addressed and we confirm your compliance 
with CGMP. We may re-inspect to verify that you have 
completed corrective actions to address any violations. This letter notifies 
you of our findings and provides you an opportunity to 
address the above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, respond 
to this office in writing within 15 working days. Specify 
what you have done to address any violations and to 
prevent their recurrence. In response to this letter, you may 
provide additional information for our consideration as we continue to 
assess your activities and practices. If you cannot complete corrective 
actions within 15 working days, state your reasons for delay 
and your schedule for completion. Send your electronic reply to 
Jose R. Lopez, Compliance Officer, at ORAPHARM2_RESPONSES@fda.hhs.gov. In addition, please 
submit a signed copy of your response to joser.lopez@fda.hhs.gov and 
ronda.loyd-jones@fda.hhs.gov. Your written notification should refer to case # 641808. 
If you have questions regarding the contents of this letter, 
you may contact Jose R. Lopez via (787) 729-8603 or

Sincerely, /S/ Monica R. Maxwell Program Division Director Office 
of Pharmaceutical Quality Operations, Division II _______________________________ 1 Due to 
an increased demand for alcohol-based hand sanitizers during the COVID-19 
pandemic, the FDA published the Guidance for Industry: Temporary Policy 
for Preparation of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the 
Public Health Emergency (COVID-19) on March 19, 2020, and subsequently 
updated the guidance several times. The guidance was withdrawn effective 
December 31, 2021 (86 Fed Reg at 56960). This guidance 
communicated the Agency’s temporary policy that we did not intend 
to take action against firms for CGMP violations under section 
501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act if such firms prepared alcohol-based 
hand sanitizers for consumer use (or for use as a 
health care personnel hand rub) during the public health emergency, 
provided certain circumstances described in the guidance were present. These 
circumstances included preparation of hand sanitizer products using only the 
ingredients and formulas set forth in the guidance. Because Auto-Chlor 
System LLC hand sanitizer drug products were not consistent with 
the formulations described in these guidances, they did not fall 
within any temporary Agency policy not to take action against 
firms manufacturing hand sanitizer products for violations of section 505 
of the FD&C Act. 2 We note that your HAND 
KLEEN FOAMING INSTANT HAND SANITIZER drug product’s labeling contains conflicting 
information regarding whether it should be used as consumer antiseptic 
rub/consumer antiseptic wash or consumer antiseptic rub. The term “hand 
sanitizer” generally refers to consumer antiseptic rubs, and the Drug 
Facts Label of your product both indicates that the product 
is to be used for handwashing (presumably with water) and 
suggests that it should be used without water (i.e., “Apply 
a small amount to palm · Briskly rub, covering hands 
with product until dry”). This product, however, does not conform 
to the requirements for either a consumer antiseptic rub or 
a consumer antiseptic wash, as further described below. 01/10/2023 More

United States November 2, 2022 WARNING LETTER 


Dear Yasuo Takeuchi: 
During an inspection of your firm located in Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima, 
Japan, on July 5, 2022, through July 8, 2022, an 
investigator (or investigators) from the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) determined that your firm manufactures sterile and non-sterile 
Endoscopes and Automated Endoscope Reprocessors. Under section 201(h) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. 
§ 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended 
for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions 
or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, 
or to affect the structure or any function of the 
body. This inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within 
the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 
§ 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the 
facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or 
installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing 
practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 
21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. We received 
a response from Kenji Matsuoka, President of Aizu Olympus, dated 
July 29, 2022, concerning our investigator's observations noted on the 
Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations, that 
was issued to your firm. We address this response below, 
in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations 
include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Failure 
to establish and maintain procedures for validating the device design 
to ensure that devices conform to defined user needs and 
intended uses and validation shall include testing of production units 
under actual or simulated use conditions, as required by 21 
CFR 820.30(g). For example: Document (b)(4), “Design Rules” version 13 
defines Design Validation as, (b)(4).” However, User-Assessment Procedures for URF-V3/V3R 
and UFR-P7/P7R Validation Report Document #(b)(4), dated October 4, 2017, 
states that only the, “(b)(4)” of the URF-V3/V3R and URF-P7/P7R 
needed to be evaluated. The entire device design was not 
validated to ensure that devices conform to defined user needs 
under actual or simulated use conditions. For example, image quality 
was not validated. The adequacy of your firm's response cannot 
be determined at this time. Your firm decided they would 
re-validate the URF-P7 to cover all user needs. Your firm 
will determine the due date for the validation activities after 
your firm completes the design validation plan (due October 14, 
2022). You state that your firm will also revise the 
design controls procedure to clarify that design validation will cover 
the entire device under review and determine what elements are 
required in a justification for the use of an alternate 
device. Your firm will review design projects for the last 
two years for similar issues. Your firm plans to complete 
corrective actions by November 18, 2022. Your firm will train 
staff on revised procedures. However, the adequacy of the corrective 
actions cannot be determined at this time because the actions 
are ongoing. Please provide updates on the corrective actions as 
they are completed. 2. Failure to ensure that when the 
results of a process cannot be fully verified by subsequent 
inspection and test that the process shall be validated with 
a high degree of assurance and approved according to established 
procedure, as required by 21 CFR 820.75(a). For example: the 
bonding/gluing processes using the (b)(4) and (b)(4) adhesives during final 
assembly have not been validated. (b)(4) Docking Work Instruction, Document 
#(b)(4) (among others) follows the application of adhesive with “(b)(4)” 
which cannot fully verify the application of the adhesive. Your 
firm's response is not adequate. Your firm determined the output 
of ‘preventing screws from loosening’ is not verifiable and you 
state that your firm will conduct a health hazard evaluation 
(HHE) by August 31, 2022 to determine the health risk 
from the screws loosening. Your firm will update their process 
validation procedures with criteria for when a process is verifiable 
by October 31, 2022. In addition, your firm will review 
all manufacturing processes at Aizu Olympus to ensure that processes 
whose outputs cannot be verified are validated by October 31, 
2022. You state that your firm will train staff on 
revised procedures by October 31, 2022. Your firm did not 
state if there are previously distributed devices that were made 
with specifications that were not validated. Your firm did not 
provide information on addressing the lack of knowledge of previous 
curing times and it is unclear how these products meet 
validation criteria. Your firm’s HHE should address these concerns and 
determine if a correction or removal is necessary. Your firm 
should also determine through the HHE whether this issue could 
have any impact on device reprocessing. Your firm's response is 
not adequate because, the sample size for the adhesive process 
validation is unclear. Secondly, it is also unclear if there 
are previously distributed devices that were made with specifications that 
were not validated. Thirdly, how your firm will address the 
lack of knowledge of previous curing times and determine if 
products meet validation criteria. Fourthly, it is unclear if inadequate 
curing of the adhesive could lead to reprocessing issues (e.g. 
material getting stuck in and around the adhesive and making 
it difficult to adequately reprocess the device). Finally, your firm 
should assess if a correction or removal is necessary. Please 
provide updates on the corrective actions as they are completed. 
3. Failure to establish and maintain procedures to ensure that 
Design History Record (DHR) for each batch, lot, or unit 
are maintained to demonstrate that the device is manufactured accordance 
with the DMR and the requirements of 21 CFR 820, 
as required by 21 CFR 820.184. For example: the curing 
time ((b)(4) hours or more) for the adhesive bonding/gluing process 
during final assembly was not documented on all 11 URF-P7 
DHRs reviewed during the inspection. Additionally, the ultrasonic cleaning process 
used to clean various components during final assembly was not 
documented on all 11 URF-P7 DHRs reviewed during the inspection. 
Your firm’s response indicated that the curing and ultrasonic cleaning 
process parameters were not documented in the URF-P7 DHR. Your 
firm’s root cause investigation determined that there was no requirement 
to record these parameters. Your firm provided: Your firm is 
conducting an HHE of the risk for falling to document 
the curing time and ultrasonic cleaning parameters. Your firm plans 
to complete the HHE by August 31, 2022. Your firm 
also plans to update the DHR for the URF-P7 to 
include process parameters for the bonding and cleaning processes by 
August 3, 2022. Your firm also plans to review AMS 
A05209W1 Control of Process to determine if there are other 
process parameters that should be monitored and are not. This 
review will be completed by September 16, 2022. Your firm 
will update AMS A05209W1 by December 9, 2022, to: Your 
firm will then review all DHRs for currently manufactured devices 
and remediate gaps as necessary. Your firm will complete the 
DHR review by January 31, 2022. The adequacy of your 
firm’s corrective actions cannot be determined at this time because 
the actions are ongoing. Please provide updates on the corrective 
actions as they are completed. Our inspection also revealed that 
your firm's sterile and non-sterile Endoscopes and and Automated Endoscope 
Reprocessors devices are misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 
21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm failed or 
refused to furnish material or information respecting the device that 
is required by or under section 519 of the Act, 
21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR Part 803 - 
Medical Device Reporting. These violations include, but are not limited 
to, the following: 4. Failure to develop, maintain, and implement 
written MDR procedures as required by 21 CFR 803.17. For 
example: during this inspection, your firm acknowledged that it had 
not established written MDR procedures. In the response, your firm 
developed two documents titled “CoE Global MDR: Handling US MDR 
Reporting for Potential Adverse Event Complaints”, GSOP-8.15-7, Rev. AD, dated 
7/13/2022 and “Medical Device Reporting Work Instruction”, OMBS W 8.2.3_01_001, 
Rev. 13, dated 7/26/2022. The documents collectively were referenced as 
your firm’s MDR procedure. The document references Aizu Olympus Co. 
Ltd. as a Manufacturer. Your firm did not provide documentation 
or evidence of implementation. You state that plans for staff 
training and MDR reporting process realignment are still ongoing. Therefore, 
the adequacy of your firm's response cannot be determined at 
this time. Please provide updates on the corrective actions as 
they are completed. U.S. federal agencies may take your compliance 
history into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, 
should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations 
that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class 
III devices, such devices will not be approved until the 
violations have been addressed. Please notify this office in writing, 
within fifteen business days from the date you receive this 
letter, of the specific steps your firm has taken to 
correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of 
how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar 
violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or 
corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm 
has taken. If your firm's planned corrections and/or corrective actions 
will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation 
of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be 
completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the 
delay and the time within which these activities will be 
completed. Your firm's response should be comprehensive and address all 
violations included in this Warning Letter. If you believe that 
your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, 
include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration 
as part of your response. Please provide a translation of 
documentation not in English to facilitate our review. We will 
notify you regarding the adequacy of your firm's response(s) and 
the need to re-inspect your firm's facility to verify that 
the appropriate corrections and/or corrective actions have been made. Your 
firm's response should be sent to CDRHWarningLetterResponses@fda.hhs.gov, or if e-mail 
cannot be used: Food and Drug Administration - CDRH/ORP/DRP2 CDRH

of this letter, please contact: Mark Antonino at Mark.Antonino@fda.hhs.gov. Finally, 
you should know that this letter is not intended to 
be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm's 
facility. It is your firm's responsibility to ensure compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations 
noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 
483, issued at the close of the inspection may be 
symptomatic of serious problems in your firm's manufacturing and quality 
management systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes 
of the violations, and take prompt actions to correct the 
violations and bring the products into compliance.

States December 12, 2022 


Dear Tomohisa Sakurai: During an inspection 
of your firm located in Hachioji-shi, Tokyo, Japan, on September 
6, 2022, through September 9, 2022, an investigator (or investigators) 
from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined 
that your firm manufactures gastrointestinal and surgical endoscopes. Under section 
201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the 
Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because 
they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease 
or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or 
prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any 
function of the body. Our inspection revealed that your firm's 
gastrointestinal and surgical endoscopes are misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of 
the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm 
failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the 
device that is required by or under section 519 of 
the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR Part 
803 - Medical Device Reporting. We received a response from 
your firm, dated September 30, 2022, to the Form FDA 
483 (FDA 483). We address this response below, in relation 
to each of the noted violation(s). These violation(s) include, but 
are not limited to, the following: 1. Failure to submit 
a report to FDA no later than 30 calendar days 
after the day that your firm received or otherwise became 
aware of information, from any source, that reasonably suggests that 
a device that your firm markets has malfunctioned and this 
device or a similar device that it markets would be 
likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious 
injury, if the malfunction were to recur, as required by 
21 CFR 803.50(a)(2). For example, the information in complaint (b)(4) 
(MDR# 8010047-2021-02641), complaint (b)(4) (MDR# 8010047-2021-07387), complaint (b)(4) (MDR# 8010047-2021-11050), 
and complaint (b)(4) (MDR# 8010047-2021-09059), reasonably suggests that your firm’s 
Uretero-Reno Fiberscope and Uretero-Reno Videoscope malfunctioned (e.g., device breakage or 
rupture) while in use. Your firm failed to submit an 
MDR for each of the referenced complaints within the required 
30-calendar day timeframe. As a result of these complaints, your 
firm conducted recall Z-2518-2018, for the Uretero-reno fiberscope URF-P6, where 
it was established that such events could result in potential 
perforation of a patient’s organs. Per 21 CFR 803.3, a 
malfunction is reportable if the manufacturer takes or would be 
required to take an action under sections 518 or 519(g) 
of the Act as a result of the malfunction of 
the device or other similar devices. As such, each of 
the referenced complaints represents an MDR-reportable malfunction, as defined in 
21 CFR 803.3. The adequacy of your firm’s response dated 
September 30, 2022, cannot be determined at this time as 
the response notes that your firm is continuing to implement 
its systemic corrective actions, including optimizing the MDR reporting process 
and staff training. However, the adequacy of your firm’s response 
cannot be determined because your firm’s actions are presently ongoing. 
When your firm’s corrective actions are completed, please provide documentation 
or evidence of the systemic corrective actions, including a copy 
of your revised MDR procedure and a retrospective review of 
complaints for reportability. U.S. federal agencies may take your compliance 
history into account when considering the award of contracts. Please 
notify this office in writing, within fifteen business days from 
the date you receive this letter, of the specific steps 
your firm has taken to correct the noted violation, as 
well as an explanation of how your firm plans to 
prevent the violation, or similar violation, from occurring again. Include 
documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address 
systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm's 
planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please 
include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections 
and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, 
state the reason for the delay and the time within 
which these activities will be completed. Your firm's response should 
be comprehensive and address all violation included in this Warning 
Letter. If you believe that your products are not in 
violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any 
supporting information for our consideration as part of your response. 
Please provide a translation of documentation not in English to 
facilitate our review. We will notify you regarding the adequacy 
of your firm's response(s) and the need to re-inspect your 
firm's facility to verify that the appropriate corrections and/or corrective 
actions have been made. Your firm's response should be sent

FL 33122-1986 United States United States WARNING LETTER January 9, 
2023 RE: 643724 


Dear Mr. Flores: The U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility located in Doral, FL, 
on June 2-3, 7, 10, and 14, 2022. FDA obtained 
a sample and labeling of your product “SANGTER Natural Male 
Energy Supplement” (hereinafter “SANGTER Energy Supplement”) during the inspection. We 
also reviewed your firm’s website at www.sangter.com. Based on the 
inspection and review of your product labeling, including your firm’s 
website, FDA determined that “SANGTER Energy Supplement” is an unapproved 
new drug sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 
21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, the product is a 
misbranded drug under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 
U.S.C. 352, and sold in violation of section 301(a) of 
the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). As explained further below, 
introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce 
violates the FD&C Act. FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that 
a sample of your product, “SANGTER Energy Supplement,” contains the 
undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), sildenafil, which is a phosphodiesterase 
type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. Sildenafil is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in 
Viagra, an FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction 
(ED).1 Information on the labels and/or labeling of “SANGTER Energy 
Supplement” demonstrates that the sampled product is marketed as a 
dietary supplement. However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 
21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a dietary supplement may not include an 
article that is approved as a new drug under section 
505 of the FD&C Act unless that article was marketed 
as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as 
a drug. FDA approved Viagra (containing sildenafil as the active 
ingredient) as a new drug on March 27, 1998. Prior 
to that date, sildenafil had not been marketed as a 
food or dietary supplement. Given that sildenafil was not marketed 
as a dietary supplement or as a food before Viagra 
was approved, “SANGTER Energy Supplement” is excluded from the definition 
of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C 
Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i). Unapproved New Drug “SANGTER Energy Supplement” 
is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1) because it is intended for 
use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of 
disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function 
of the body. Examples of claims observed on your website 
homepage, www.sangter.com, that establish the intended use of this product 
as a drug include, but may not be limited to, 
the following: • “100% Natural Male Performance Booster” • “Damiana 
(turnera diffusa) It is a plant known for its aphrodisiac 
qualities that help stimulate the sexual appetite or libido” • 
“In just 30 minutes or less after consumption you will 
feel its effect, more energy, more sexual desire and more 
power.” • “Its main use applies to erectile dysfunction and 
low sexual desire, but it is also used against general 
weakness, painfulness, spontaneous sweat.” “SANGTER Energy Supplement” is not generally 
recognized as safe and effective for its above referenced uses 
and, therefore, is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of 
the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not 
applicable here, a new drug may not be legally introduced 
or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval 
from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) 
of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There 
is no FDA-approved application in effect for “SANGTER Energy Supplement.” 
Introduction or delivery of this product into interstate commerce without 
an approved application violates sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Misbranded Drug “SANGTER 
Energy Supplement” is also misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that the labeling fails 
to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions 
for use” means directions under which a layman can use 
a drug safely and for the purposes for which it 
is intended, 21 C.F.R. 201.5. All PDE-5 inhibitors which have 
been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an 
approved new drug application to use under the supervision of 
a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. Prescription 
drugs can only be used safely at the direction and 
under the supervision of a licensed practitioner. “SANGTER Energy Supplement,” 
which contains undeclared sildenafil, is also a prescription drug as 
defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
353(b)(1)(A), in light of its toxicity or potential for harmful 
effects, methods of use, or collateral measures necessary for its 
use. Therefore, it is impossible to write “adequate directions for 
use” for prescription drugs, including “SANGTER Energy Supplement.” “SANGTER Energy 
Supplement” is not exempt from the requirements that its labeling 
bear adequate directions for use by a layperson, 21 CFR 
201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because there is no FDA-approved application in 
effect for this product. For these reasons, “SANGTER Energy Supplement” 
is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. Additionally, 
“SANGTER Energy Supplement” is misbranded under section 502(a) of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if 
its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 
201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, 
in determining whether an article's labeling or advertising “is misleading 
there shall be taken into account . . . not 
only representations made or suggested . . . but also 
the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to 
reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling 
for “SANGTER Energy Supplement” does not declare that the product 
contains a PDE-5 inhibitor. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can 
be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of 
serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in “SANGTER Energy 
Supplement” may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying 
medical issues may take the products without knowing that they 
can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with 
other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors 
may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such 
as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. 
Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often 
take nitrates. The failure to disclose this ingredient in the 
product’s labeling renders “SANGTER Energy Supplement” misbranded under section 502(a) 
of the FD&C Act. The undeclared sildenafil in “SANGTER Energy 
Supplement” also causes the product to be misbranded under section 
502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because the 
labeling lacks adequate warning for the protection of users. As 
previously noted, there is a potential for serious health risks 
associated with this product, particularly since anyone who takes these 
products would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared 
drug ingredient and placed at risk for the associated adverse 
events. The introduction, delivery for introduction, or causing the introduction 
or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded 
drug is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the 
FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). Conclusion This letter is not 
intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may 
exist in connection with your product. You are responsible for 
investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for 
preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It 
is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with 
all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations. This letter 
notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity 
to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may 
result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. 
FDA acknowledges that on August 1, 2022, you initiated a 
voluntary nationwide recall of Lot #48656, Exp. 01/2025 of “SANGTER 
Energy Supplement,” 3000 mg, packaged in 7-count blister packs within 
a carton to the consumer level. We also acknowledge that 
you notified your customers of the recall by press release 
on August 2, 2022. Please notify FDA in writing, within 
fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the 
specific steps you have taken to correct these violations. Include 
an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the 
recurrence of violations as well as copies of related documentation. 
If you believe that your products are not in violation 
of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting 
information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action 
within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay 
and the time within which you will complete the correction.

States Food and Drug Administration RE: Notice of Unlawful Sale 
of Unapproved and Misbranded Drugs to United States Consumers Over 
the Internet DATE: January 6, 2023 WARNING LETTER This is 
to advise you that the United States (U.S.) Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed your website at the Internet 
address www.pharmahealthonline.com and has observed that your website introduces into 
interstate commerce misbranded and unapproved new drugs in violation of 
sections 301(a), 301(d), and 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(a), 331(d), 
and 355(a)]. As discussed below, FDA has observed that www.pharmahealthonline.com 
introduces into interstate commerce unapproved and misbranded opioid drug products. 
Opioid addiction and abuse have created an immense public health 
crisis, and the death toll is staggering. Given the severity 
of the opioid epidemic, the easy availability of opioids via 
the Internet poses significant risks to U.S. consumers. FDA has 
also observed that www.pharmahealthonline.com introduces into interstate commerce unapproved and 
misbranded benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are drug products with an acknowledged potential 
for abuse, and it is important to address the public 
health impact of their nonmedical use. Benzodiazepine nonmedical use is 
widespread, and individuals frequently co-use benzodiazepines with alcohol, prescription opioids, 
and illicit drugs. Associated harms of benzodiazepine nonmedical use are 
substantial, but occur primarily when people use benzodiazepines in combination 
with other drugs. Further, in cases where benzodiazepines were co-used 
with other substances, medical outcomes are typically more severe than 
in cases involving benzodiazepines alone. Polysubstance overdose deaths account for 
the vast majority of overdose deaths documenting involvement of benzodiazepines. 
The easy availability of benzodiazepines via the Internet poses additional 
significant risks to U.S. consumers. There are inherent risks to 
consumers who purchase unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs. Unapproved 
new drugs do not carry the same assurances of safety 
and effectiveness as those drugs subject to FDA oversight. Drugs 
that have circumvented regulatory safeguards may be contaminated, counterfeit, contain 
varying amounts of active ingredients, or contain different ingredients altogether. 
Accordingly, FDA requests that www.pharmahealthonline.com cease offering any unapproved and 
misbranded drugs for sale to U.S. consumers. This is critical 
to shielding the American public from harm. Unapproved New Drugs: 
Certain products offered for sale by www.pharmahealthonline.com are drugs within 
the meaning of section 201(g) of the FD&C Act [21 
U.S.C. § 321(g)] because they are intended for use in 
the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or 
because they are intended to affect the structure or function 
of the body. These drugs are also new drugs as 
defined by section 201(p) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 
§ 321(p)], because they are not generally recognized as safe 
and effective for their labeled uses. With certain exceptions not 
applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or 
delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from 
FDA, as described in section 505(a) of the FD&C Act 
[21 U.S.C. § 355(a)]. No approved applications pursuant to section 
505 of the FD&C Act are in effect for these 
products. Accordingly, their introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate 
commerce violates sections 301(d) [21 U.S.C. § 331(d)] and 505(a) 
of the FD&C Act. For example, www.pharmahealthonline.com offers tramadol marketed 
as “JPDOL-100 ” manufactured by JPEE DRUGS. Your website states, 
“Tramadol is a pain relieving medication used to treat the 
symptoms of pain in individuals.” While there are FDA-approved versions 
of tramadol on the market in the U.S., there are 
no approved drug applications pursuant to section 505 of the 
FD&C Act in effect for the “JPDOL-100” manufactured by JPEE 
DRUGS and offered by www.pharmahealthonline.com. FDA-approved tramadol is indicated for 
the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid 
analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate and is 
only available pursuant to a prescription from a licensed practitioner. 
FDA-approved tramadol bears a boxed warning, commonly referred to as 
a “black box warning,” which is the strongest warning FDA 
requires, indicating that the drug carries a significant risk of 
serious or even life-threatening adverse effects. The boxed warning addresses 
risks including addiction, abuse, misuse, life-threatening respiratory depression (breathing problems), 
and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (withdrawal symptoms in newborn baby). 
In addition, when taken in conjunction with other central nervous 
system depressants, including alcohol and benzodiazepines, use may result in 
coma or death. On your website www.pharmahealthonline.com, you also offer 
alprazolam marketed as “Ksalol 1mg” manufactured by Galenika. Your website 
states, “Alprazolam is a medication used to treat the symptoms 
of anxiety and panic disorders in both men and women.” 
While there are FDA-approved versions of alprazolam on the market 
in the U.S., there are no approved drug applications pursuant 
to section 505 of the FD&C Act in effect for 
the “Ksalol 1mg” manufactured by Galenika and offered by www.pharmahealthonline.com. 
FDA‐approved alprazolam is a benzodiazepine indicated for the acute treatment 
of generalized anxiety disorder in adults and treatment of panic 
disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults and is only 
available by prescription from a licensed practitioner. FDA‐approved alprazolam bears 
a boxed warning that includes risks associated with the concomitant 
use of benzodiazepines and opioids, which may result in profound 
sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. In addition, the boxed 
warning addresses risks including abuse, misuse, addiction, and physical dependence. 
In addition, www.pharmahealthonline.com offers clonazepam marketed as “Rivotril 2mg.” Your 
website states, “Clonazepam is an anticonvulsant and it [sic] used 
to treat the symptoms of panic and anxiety attacks in 
individuals.” While there are FDA-approved versions of clonazepam on the 
market in the U.S., there are no approved drug applications 
pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act in effect 
for the “Rivotril 2mg” offered www.pharmahealthonline.com. FDA-approved clonazepam is a 
benzodiazepine indicated for the treatment of certain seizure disorders and 
panic disorder characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks and is 
only available by a prescription from a licensed practitioner. FDA-approved 
clonazepam bears a boxed warning that includes risks associated with 
the concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, which may result 
in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. In addition, 
the boxed warning addresses risks including abuse, misuse, addiction, and 
physical dependence. Misbranded Drugs: A drug is misbranded under section 
502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if 
its labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate 
directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can 
use a drug safely and for the purposes for which 
it is intended (see 21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as 
defined in section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 
§ 353(b)(1)] include those that, because of their toxicity or 
other potentiality for harmful effect, or the method of their 
use, or the collateral measures necessary for their use, are 
not safe for use except under supervision of a practitioner 
licensed by law to administer them. Prescription drugs, as defined 
in section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, can be used 
safely only at the direction, and under the supervision, of 
a licensed practitioner. Because the aforementioned drugs are prescription drugs 
intended for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and 
treatment by a layperson, adequate directions cannot be written such 
that a layperson can use the products safely for their 
intended use. Consequently, the labeling for these drugs fails to 
bear adequate directions for use, causing them to be misbranded 
under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. In addition, because 
the drugs are not approved in the U.S., they are 
also not exempt under 21 CFR 201.115(a) from the requirements 
of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. By offering these 
drugs for sale to U.S. consumers, www.pharmahealthonline.com is causing the 
introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce in violation of 
section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)]. 
FDA is sending this warning letter to www.pharmahealthonline.com because of 
the inherent risks to consumers who purchase misbranded and unapproved 
new drugs. This letter is not intended to identify all 
the ways in which your products or operations might be 
in violation of the law. It is your responsibility to 
ensure that all products you offer for sale are in 
compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. You 
should take prompt action to address any violations of the 
FD&C Act (which may include the offer for sale of 
similarly misbranded and/or unapproved new drugs other than the drugs 
noted above). We advise you to review your websites, product 
labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that 
you are not misleadingly representing your products as safe and 
effective for a use for which they have not been 
approved by FDA and that you are not distributing misbranded 
products in violation of the FD&C Act. Please notify this 
office in writing within 15 working days describing the specific 
steps you have taken to address any violations and to 
prevent their recurrence. Include an explanation of each step being 
taken to remedy and prevent the recurrence of any violations, 
as well as copies of related documentation. Failure to adequately 
address this matter may result in legal action, including, without 
limitation, seizure and injunction, without further notice. If you cannot 
complete corrective action within 15 working days, state the reason 
for the delay and the time within which you will 
complete the corrections. This letter notifies you of our concerns 
and provides you with an opportunity to address them. If 
you believe that your products are not in violation of 
the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information 
for our consideration within 15 working days. If you are 
not located in the U.S., please note that products that 
appear to be misbranded or unapproved new drugs may be 
detained or refused admission. We may advise the appropriate regulatory 
officials in the country from which you operate that your 
products referenced above appear to be unapproved and misbranded products 
that cannot be legally sold to consumers in the U.S.

Date: January 10, 2023 RE: Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related 
to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) This is to advise you 
that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at the 
Internet address https://purecraftcbd.com/ on December 14, 2022 and January 6, 
2023, respectively. We also reviewed your social media websites at 
https://www.facebook.com/purecraftcbd and https://www.instagram.com/purecraftcbd/, where you direct consumers to your website, 
https://purecraftcbd.com/, to purchase your products. The FDA has observed that 
your website offers cannabidiol (CBD) products for sale in the 
United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, 
prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191 in people. Based on 
our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in 
violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these 
products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C 
Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for 
introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under 
sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
§ 331(a) and (d). There is currently a global outbreak 
of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has 
been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The 
disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 
2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public 
health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions 
of HHS.2 In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was 
a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to 
COVID-19.3 Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers 
from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, 
claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in 
people. As described below, you sell products that are intended 
to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. 
We request that you take immediate action to cease the 
sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, 
prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19. Some examples of 
the claims on your website that establish the intended use 
of your products and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or 
effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include: “* 
This post covers research that was published since our July 
6, 2021 postReviewing [sic] Research on CBD for COVID-19 Therapy 
(which we suggest reading if you need an overview of 
how COVID-19 works in the body). To the best of 
our knowledge, the studies referenced in this article all used 
therapeutic-grade CBD that was purer or contained higher concentrations of 
cannabidiol than what’s on the market for public consumption. . 
. . COVID Prevention & CBD . . . Early 
results show that therapeutic doses of CBD do have a 
protective effect against COVID. . . . According to the 
National Institute of Health’s COVID-19 Research initiative:(1) CBD vs SARS-CoV-2 
. . . [T]he CBD does start to attach the 
virus very soon after the virus is introduced into your 
system. This anti-SARS-CoV-2 assault makes it so that the virus 
can’t spread or further develop. Basically, the CBD inhibits the 
virus’s capacity to replicate itself or change host cells in 
your body. CBD blocks the viral reproduction by activating the 
infected cell’s stress response, which makes it create virus-killing proteins. 
. . . CBD For COVID Symptoms According to a 
March 2022 article in Frontiers in Immunology, CBD has been 
shown to decrease the severity of COVID. It’s primarily doing 
this by counteracting the body’s inflammatory response to the SARS-CoV-2 
virus. . . . . Will cannabis or cannabinoids protect 
you from COVID? Current research indicates that therapeutic doses of 
CBD may provide some protection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The 
purer or higher concentration the CBD, the more effective this 
intervention seems to be.” “Interest from the medical community about 
the usefulness of CBD in battling the COVID-19 virus isn’t 
completely out of left field… [S]everal studies have emerged that 
are expected to progress our understanding of CBD’s therapeutic potential 
for COVID patients. . . . Hypothesis #1: CBD May 
Be An Option For COVID-19 Prevention Since contracting COVID-19 puts 
some at a higher risk of death and long-term effects, 
one study is focusing on the use of CBD for 
infection prevention. . . . They cultivated 800 new strains 
of Cannabis sativa L. Of these, 13 high-CBD strains were 
selected, which decreased the presence of ACE2 in 3D models 
of human respiratory and intestinal tissues. . . . Hypothesis 
#2: CBD May Reduce Inflammation Related To COVID-19 Can CBD 
help combat inflammation from a cytokine storm caused by COVID-19? 
Two studies using in vitro lung cell cultures have completed 
early stages of answering this question.(5, 6) In the first 
study, the lung cultures were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
. . . The high-CBD formula reduced inflammation considerably, whereas 
the high-THC formula had little anti-inflammatory effect. The high-CBD formula 
reduced the specific cytokines responsible for the COVID-19-induced cytokine storm. 
. . . In the second study, CBD was found 
to halt viral replication. The researchers also concluded that CBD 
was more effective than THC. In fact, of the cannabinoids 
that were tested, CBD was found to be the only 
cannabinoid that produced this outcome. This study has not yet 
been peer reviewed, but is a promising line of investigation. 
Hypothesis #3: CBD May Be Helpful In The Treatment Of 
COVID-19 . . . In another study performed on mice 
experiencing respiratory distress due to an artificially-induced cytokine storm, CBD 
reversed the negative effects and restored homeostasis.(8) This suggests that 
CBD may support recovery from the virus. Current Findings Spark 
More Questions With the facts on the known relationship between 
CBD and COVID-19 laid out, it’s clear that further research 
and incoming results will reveal CBD’s role and effectiveness as 
a therapeutic tool. For now, the medical community and the 
world have earmarked these findings as a pivotal and encouraging 
chapter amidst the rollercoaster plot of the COVID-19 pandemic.” “CBD 
& COVID-19: NEW RESEARCH, NEW FINDINGS [JUNE 2022] . . 
. So, keep reading for the latest coronavirus-CBD research on: 
- Whether preventing COVID with CBD is possible - How 
CBD interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID) 
- The COVID and cannabinoid receptors link - Potential CBD 
benefits for COVID symptoms - If CBD can curb COVID 
vaccination side effects” “REVIEWING RESEARCH ON CBD FOR COVID-19 THERAPY. 
. . CBD is being examined as a possible therapy 
for COVID-19 . . . .” You should take immediate 
action to address this matter. This letter is not meant 
to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in 
connection with your products or operations. It is your responsibility 
to ensure that the products you sell are in compliance 
with the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations. We advise 
you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling 
and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly 
representing your products as safe and effective for a COVID-19-related 
use for which they have not been approved by FDA 
and that you do not make claims that misbrand the 
products in violation of the FD&C Act. Within 48 hours, 
please send an email to COVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.gov describing the specific steps 
you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation 
of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of 
any violations, as well as copies of related documentation. Failure 
to adequately correct any violations may result in legal action, 
including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. FDA is advising consumers 
not to purchase or use certain products that have not 
been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that are 
being misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the treatment 
or prevention of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to 
a published list on FDA’s website of firms and websites 
that have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale 
or distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the 
FD&C Act. This list can be found at http://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-products. Once 
you have taken actions to address the sale of any 
unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, 
or cure of COVID-19, and any appropriate corrective actions have 
been confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be 
updated to indicate that your firm has taken such corrective 
actions. This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides 
you with an opportunity to address them. If you cannot 
take action to address this matter completely within 48 hours, 
state the reason for the delay and the time within 
which you will do so. If you believe that your 
products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include 
your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If 
you are not located in the United States, please note 
that products that appear to be misbranded or unapproved new 
drugs may be detained or refused admission if they are 
offered for importation into the United States. We may advise 
the appropriate regulatory officials in the country from which you 
operate that FDA considers your product(s) referenced above to be 
unapproved and misbranded products that cannot be legally sold to 
consumers in the United States. Please direct any inquiries to 
FDA at COVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.gov. FTC Cease and Desist Demand: In addition, 
it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 
41 et seq., to advertise that a product can prevent, 
treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and 
reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, 
substantiating that the claims are true at the time they 
are made. For COVID-19, no such study is currently known 
to exist for the products identified above. Thus, any coronavirus-related 
prevention or treatment claims regarding such products are not supported 
by competent and reliable scientific evidence. You must immediately cease 
and desist making all such claims. Violations of the FTC 
Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District 
Court injunction and an order may require that you pay 
back money to consumers. In addition, pursuant to the COVID-19 
Consumer Protection Act, Section 1401, Division FF, of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2021, P.L. 116-260, marketers who make deceptive claims 
about the treatment, cure, prevention, or mitigation of COVID-19 are 
subject to a civil penalty of up to $50,120 per 
violation and may be required to pay refunds to consumers 
or provide other relief pursuant to Section 19(b) of the 
FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 57b(b). Within 48 hours, please 
send an email to Serena Viswanathan, Associate Director of the 
FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, at sviswanathan@ftc.gov certifying that you 
have ceased making unsubstantiated claims for the product identified above.

preventing Cytokine Storms–the condition that transforms standard cases into life-threatening 
scenarios.” [From your September 2021 blog post titled “CBD FOR

of the University of Chicago and her team, who recently 
published a study in Science Advances, want to see CBD 
at the forefront of Covid-19 prevention studies. Why? Their widely 
circulated research indicated that highly potent oral CBD inhibits Covid 
infection in human lung cells and mice. According to their 
findings, CBD may work by inhibiting viral gene expression while 
boosting the body’s stress and immune responses.” [From your February

about other hemp compounds? . . . Study investigators found 
that, of hemp’s hundreds of cannabinoids, CBDa and CBGa exhibited

corrective actions have been confirmed by the FDA, the published 
list will be updated to indicate that your firm has 
taken such corrective actions. This letter notifies you of our 
concerns and provides you with an opportunity to address them. 
If you cannot take action to address this matter completely 
within 48 hours, state the reason for the delay and 
the time within which you will do so. If you 
believe that your products are not in violation of the 
FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for 
our consideration. If you are not located in the United 
States, please note that products that appear to be misbranded 
or unapproved new drugs may be detained or refused admission 
if they are offered for importation into the United States. 
We may advise the appropriate regulatory officials in the country 
from which you operate that FDA considers your product(s) referenced 
above to be unapproved and misbranded products that cannot be 
legally sold to consumers in the United States. Please direct 
any inquiries to FDA at COVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.gov. FTC Cease and Desist 
Demand: In addition, it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 
15 U.S.C. § 41 et seq., to advertise that a 
product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you 
possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled 
human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at 
the time they are made. For COVID-19, no such study 
is currently known to exist for the products identified above. 
Thus, any coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims regarding such products 
are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. You 
must immediately cease and desist making all such claims. Violations 
of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking 
a Federal District Court injunction and an order may require 
that you pay back money to consumers. In addition, pursuant 
to the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act, Section 1401, Division FF, 
of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, P.L. 116-260, marketers who 
make deceptive claims about the treatment, cure, prevention, or mitigation 
of COVID-19 are subject to a civil penalty of up 
to $50,120 per violation and may be required to pay 
refunds to consumers or provide other relief pursuant to Section 
19(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 57b(b). Within 
48 hours, please send an email to Serena Viswanathan, Associate 
Director of the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, at sviswanathan@ftc.gov 
certifying that you have ceased making unsubstantiated claims for the 
product identified above. If you have any questions regarding compliance 
with the FTC Act, please contact Ms. Viswanathan at 202-326-3244.

United States United States January 12, 2023 WARNING LETTER 


Dear 
Mr. Heinrichs: The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions to 
the FDA and our inspection records, and determined that Tiger 
Vapes manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for commercial distribution in 
the United States, and that the e-liquid products are manufactured 
and offered for sale or distribution to customers in the 
United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these 
products are tobacco products because they are made or derived 
from tobacco or contain nicotine from any source, and intended 
for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are 
subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1, 
and are required to be in compliance with the requirements 
in the FD&C Act. Please be aware that, on March 
15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C 
Act to extend FDA’s jurisdiction to products “containing nicotine from 
any source,” not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, 
Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of “tobacco 
product” under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. 
Tobacco products, including e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, 
must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its 
implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14. Generally, to 
be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act 
requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization in 
effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that 
was not commercially marketed in the United States as of 
February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was 
commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the 
FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization 
order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless 
(1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under 
section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) 
and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent 
to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C 
Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 
905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and 
all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of 
substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).New Tobacco Products Without Required 
Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded FDA has determined that 
you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to customers in the United 
States Grape Berries e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order. 
The e-liquid products listed above are new tobacco products because 
they were not commercially marketed in the United States as 
of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA 
marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the 
FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing 
authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, 
they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information 
respecting these products was not provided as required by section 
905(j) of the FD&C Act. The doing of any act 
with respect to a tobacco product while such article is 
held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results 
in such product being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited 
act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 331(k)). Additionally, to the extent that a report was 
required under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure 
to provide such report is a prohibited act under section 
301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)). Conclusion 
and Requested Actions FDA has not received an application from 
your firm requesting marketing authorization for the products listed in 
this Warning Letter. These products and any other new tobacco 
product on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization 
are adulterated and misbranded and are subject to enforcement action 
at FDA’s discretion. It is your responsibility to ensure that 
all of your tobacco products comply with each applicable provision 
of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to 
address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 
301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products including 
the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 
1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited 
to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning 
Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 
303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products 
offered for import into the United States that appear to 
be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission. 
The violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute 
an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address 
any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations 
that are the same as or similar to the ones 
stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your 
tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act. Please submit 
a written response to this letter within 15 working days 
from the date of receipt describing your actions to address 
any violations and bring your products into compliance, including the 
dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution 
of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance 
with the FD&C Act. If you believe that your products 
are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your 
reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This letter 
notifies you of our findings and provides you with an 
opportunity to address them. You can find the FD&C Act

LETTER 


Dear Devin Matthews: The Center for Tobacco Products of 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your 
submissions to the FDA and our inspection records, and determined 
that Chevaline Investments, LLC d/b/a VaporCore manufactures and distributes e-liquid 
products for commercial distribution in the United States, and that 
the e-liquid products are manufactured and offered for sale or 
distribution to customers in the United States. Under section 201(rr) 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) 
(21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because 
they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for 
human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject 
to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1. Therefore, 
these products are required to be in compliance with the 
requirements in the FD&C Act. Please be aware that, effective 
August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition 
of a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly deemed 
products, to be subject to regulation under the FD&C Act. 
These products include, but are not limited to, electronic nicotine 
delivery systems (including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and pipe tobacco. 
See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by 
the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on 
the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning 
Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 
2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. The FD&C Act requires “new tobacco 
products” to have a premarket authorization in effect. A “new 
tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially 
marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, 
or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after 
February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 
U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 
910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is 
required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer 
of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues 
an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate 
tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) 
the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are 
covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted 
by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)). New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization 
Are Adulterated and Misbranded FDA has determined that you manufacture, 
sell, and/or distribute to customers in the United States Brandy 
e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order. The tobacco products 
listed above are new tobacco products because they were not 
commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 
2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders 
in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and 
are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, 
these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded 
under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products 
were not provided as required by section 905(j) of the 
FD&C Act. The doing of any act with respect to 
a tobacco product while such article is held for sale 
after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such product 
being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited act under section 
301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, 
to the extent that a report was required under section 
905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure to provide such 
report is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)). Conclusion and Requested Actions 
All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily 
required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to 
enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. Products for which no application 
is pending, including, for example, those with a Marketing Denial 
Order and those for which no application was submitted, are 
among our highest enforcement priorities. For information on how FDA 
intends to prioritize enforcement resources with regard to the marketing 
of certain adulterated and misbranded ENDS and other deemed new

Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) and Other Deemed

LETTER 


Dear Devin Matthews: The Center for Tobacco Products of 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your 
submissions to the FDA and our inspection records, and determined 
that Chevaline Investments, LLC d/b/a VaporCore manufactures and distributes e-liquid 
products for commercial distribution in the United States, and that 
the e-liquid products are manufactured and offered for sale or 
distribution to customers in the United States. Under section 201(rr) 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) 
(21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because 
they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for 
human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject 
to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1. Therefore, 
these products are required to be in compliance with the 
requirements in the FD&C Act. Please be aware that, effective 
August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition 
of a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly deemed 
products, to be subject to regulation under the FD&C Act. 
These products include, but are not limited to, electronic nicotine 
delivery systems (including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, and pipe tobacco. 
See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by 
the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on 
the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning 
Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 
2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. The FD&C Act requires “new tobacco 
products” to have a premarket authorization in effect. A “new 
tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially 
marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, 
or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after 
February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 
U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 
910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is 
required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer 
of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues 
an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate 
tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) 
the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are 
covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted 
by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)). New Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization 
Are Adulterated and Misbranded FDA has determined that you manufacture, 
sell, and/or distribute to customers in the United States Brandy 
e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order. The tobacco products 
listed above are new tobacco products because they were not 
commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 
2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders 
in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and 
are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, 
these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded 
under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products 
were not provided as required by section 905(j) of the 
FD&C Act. The doing of any act with respect to 
a tobacco product while such article is held for sale 
after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such product 
being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited act under section 
301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, 
to the extent that a report was required under section 
905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure to provide such 
report is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)). Conclusion and Requested Actions 
All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily 
required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to 
enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. Products for which no application 
is pending, including, for example, those with a Marketing Denial 
Order and those for which no application was submitted, are 
among our highest enforcement priorities. For information on how FDA 
intends to prioritize enforcement resources with regard to the marketing 
of certain adulterated and misbranded ENDS and other deemed new 
tobacco products, please refer to the FDA’s guidance titled Enforcement 
Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) and Other Deemed 
Products on the Market Without Premarket Authorization, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market. 
It is your responsibility to ensure that all of your 
tobacco products comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C 
Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations 
of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., 
Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations 
in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead 
to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money 
penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not 
constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the 
FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import 
into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or 
misbranded may be detained or refused admission. The violations discussed 
in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. 
You should take prompt action to address any violations that 
are referenced above, as well as violations that are the 
same as or similar to the ones stated above, and 
take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into 
compliance with the FD&C Act. Please submit a written response 
to this letter within 15 working days from the date 
of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and 
bring your products into compliance, including the dates on which 
you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco 
products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C 
Act. If you believe that your products are not in 
violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any 
supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of 
our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address 
them. You can find the FD&C Act through links on

Dear 
Mr. Lee: This letter is to advise you that the 
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website 
at the Internet address www.adamssecret.com, in May 2022 and again 
in December 2022, where you take orders for “Adam’s Secret 
Extra Strength 3000 Platinum,” “Adam’s Secret Extra Strength Blue,” “Adam’s 
Secret Extra Strength Purple,” “Adam's Secret Extra Strength Amazing Black,” 
“Adam’s Secret Extra Strength 2000,” (hereinafter referred to as your 
“Adam’s Secret” products) and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense.” We also 
reviewed your social media websites at www.instagram.com/adamssecretus and www.facebook.com/AdamsSecretUSA, where 
you direct consumers to your website, www.adamssecret.com, to purchase your 
products. In addition, FDA has obtained samples and labeling of 
your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products. As 
described below, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in 
violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 
331(d). Furthermore, your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” 
products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C 
Act, 21 U.S.C. 352 and sold in violation of section 
301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). FDA confirmed 
through laboratory analysis that samples of your Adam’s Secret and 
“Dr. Slim Sense” products contain undeclared pharmaceutical ingredients.1 Specifically, samples 
of your “Adam’s Secret Extra Strength 3000 Platinum,” “Adam’s Secret 
Extra Strength Blue,” and “Adam's Secret Extra Strength Amazing Black,” 
products contain tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. In addition, 
samples of your “Adam’s Secret Extra Strength Purple” and “Adam’s 
Secret Extra Strength 2000” products contain tadalafil and sildenafil. Tadalafil 
is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and the active ingredient 
in the FDA-approved prescription drug Cialis used to treat erectile 
dysfunction (ED). Sildenafil is a PDE-5 inhibitor and the active 
ingredient in the FDA-approved prescription drug Viagra also used to 
treat ED. These undeclared ingredients may interact with nitrates found 
in some prescription drugs, such as nitroglycerin, and may lower 
blood pressure to dangerous levels. Men with diabetes, high blood 
pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease, often take nitrates. Additionally, 
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your 
“Dr. Reade Slim Sense” product contains lorcaserin, a controlled substance 
and the active ingredient in the withdrawn prescription drug Belviq, 
formerly used for chronic weight management in some overweight or 
obese adults. Lorcaserin may cause psychiatric disturbances and impairments in 
attention or memory. Further, this hidden drug ingredient may also 
interact with other medications and significantly increase the risk of 
adverse events. Belviq was withdrawn from the market on September 
2020 after FDA requested that the manufacturer voluntarily withdraw the 
drug because of a safety clinical trial that showed an 
increased occurrence of cancer. Information on the labels and/or labeling 
of your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products 
demonstrate that they are marketed as dietary supplements. However, under 
section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a 
dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved 
as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C 
Act unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement 
or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved 
Cialis (containing tadalafil as the active ingredient) as a new 
drug on November 21, 2003, and approved Viagra (containing sildenafil 
as the active ingredient) as a new drug on March 
27, 1998. Given that tadalafil and sildenafil were not marketed 
as dietary supplements or as food before Cialis and Viagra 
were approved, your Adam’s Secret products are excluded from the 
definition of dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C 
Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i). Similarly, “Dr. Reade Slim Sense,” which 
contains lorcaserin, is also excluded from the definition of a 
dietary supplement. According to section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 
21 U.S.C. 321 (ff)(3)(B)(ii), the definition of a dietary supplement 
does not include an article authorized for investigation as a 
new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted 
and made public unless the article was marketed as a 
dietary supplement or food before its authorization for investigation as 
a new drug. Lorcaserin has been authorized for investigation as 
a new drug under an investigational new drug (IND) application. 
When Belviq was approved for marketing as a new drug 
in the United States, the existence of substantial completed clinical 
investigations of lorcaserin became public. Based on the information available 
to FDA, lorcaserin was not marketed as a dietary supplement 
or as a food before it was authorized for investigation 
as a new drug. Therefore, “Dr. Reade Slim Sense,” which 
contains lorcaserin, is excluded from the definition of a dietary 
supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
321 (ff)(3)(B)(ii). Unapproved New Drugs Your Adam’s Secret and your 
“Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products are drugs as defined by 
section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act 21, U.S.C. 321(g)(1) because 
they are intended to prevent, treat, or cure disease conditions 
and/or affect the structure or function of the body. Examples 
of claims observed on your website and social media websites 
that establish the intended use of your Adam’s Secret and 
“Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products as drugs include, but are 
not limited to, the following: Adam’s Secret Products From your 
product page for your Adam’s Secret products, on your website 
www.adamssecret.com: From your website www.adamssecret.com/pages/about: o “Native to the Peruvian 
Andes mountain range, Maca is known to help enhance libido, 
increase sperm count, plus improve mood and energy.” o “Ginkgo 
biloba is a tree native to China. The extract is 
made from the tree’s fan-shaped leaves. Its purpose in their 
formula is to increase blood flow and circulation.” o “Saw 
Palmetto . . . In Adams Secret, it is a 
great natural ingredient to help naturally boost testosterone.” o “Epimedium 
Sagitatum . . . It is sometimes referred to as 
a ‘natural viagra’ because it similarly increases blood flow to 
the penis, just like Viagra, without the potential side effects.” 
o “Stinging nettle is most commonly used for diabetes and 
osteoarthritis. It is also sometimes used for urinary tract infections 
(UTIs), kidney stones, enlarged prostate, hay fever, and other conditions.” 
o “Cnidium is most commonly used for increasing sexual performance 
and sex drive, erectile dysfunction (ED).” o “Tongkat Ali . 
. . It’s often used to treat a variety of 
ailments, including fevers, erectile dysfunction, and bacterial infections.” o “Forskolin 
works on muscles in the heart and in the walls 
of the blood vessels. It produces a more powerful heartbeat 
and widening of the blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure.” 
From your website www.adamssecret.com, clicking on “Read More” directs to 
an article titled “Just Take It Adams Secret” at www.inlovemag.com/just-take-it/, 
which includes many of the claims listed under the previous 
sub bullets, including but not limited to: From your social 
media pages, at www.instagram.com/adamssecretus and www.facebook.com/AdamsSecretUSA, you posted the following 
on November 15, 2022: “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” From your 
website www.adamssecret.com/products/slim-sense-10-capsules: Your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” 
products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for 
their above referenced uses and, therefore, they are “new drugs” 
under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). 
With certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may 
not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate 
commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in 
sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
331(d) and 355(a). There is no FDA-approved application in effect 
for your Adam’s Secret or “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products. 
Introduction or delivery for introduction of these product into interstate 
commerce without an approved application violates sections 505(a) and 301(d) 
of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Misbranded 
Drugs Your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products 
are also misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 
21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fail to bear 
adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions 
under which a layman can use a drug safely and 
for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 
201.5). All PDE-5 inhibitors which have been approved for marketing 
by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application 
to use under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by 
law to administer such drugs. Your Adam’s Secret products, which 
contain undeclared sildenafil and/or tadalafil, and your “Dr. Reade Slim 
Sense” product, which contains undeclared lorcaserin, are prescription drugs, as 
defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
353(b)(1)(A), in light of their toxicity or potential for harmful 
effects, methods of use, or collateral measures necessary for their 
use. Prescription drugs can be used safely only at the 
direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, 
it is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for 
prescription drugs, including your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim 
Sense” products. Your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” 
products are not exempt from the requirements that their labeling 
bear adequate directions for use by a layperson, 21 CFR 
201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because there is no FDA approved application 
in effect for these products. For these reasons, your Adam’s 
Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products are misbranded under 
section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. Additionally, your Adam’s Secret 
and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products are misbranded under section 
502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 
502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug 
is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in 
any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article's labeling or 
advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . 
. . not only representations made or suggested . . 
. but also the extent to which the labeling or 
advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such 
representations.” The labeling for your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade 
Slim Sense” products do not declare that the products contain 
a PDE-5 inhibitor or lorcacerin. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors 
can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk 
of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your 
Adam’s Secret products may pose serious health risks because consumers 
with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing 
that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous 
ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, 
PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription 
drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to 
dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart 
disease often take nitrates. The presence of undeclared lorcaserin in 
your “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” product may cause psychiatric disturbances 
and impairments in attention or memory. Further, this hidden drug 
ingredient may also interact with other medications and significantly increase 
the risk of adverse events. The failure to disclose these 
ingredients in the products’ labeling renders your Adam’s Secret and 
“Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products misbranded under section 502(a) of 
the FD&C Act. The undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients in your 
products also cause these products to be misbranded under section 
502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because their 
labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users. As 
previously noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with 
the use of PDE-5 inhibitors and/or lorcaserin. Consumers who use 
your Adam’s Secret and/or your “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products 
would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug 
ingredients and placed at risk for their associated adverse events. 
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of 
these misbranded drug products is a prohibited act under section 
301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). Conclusion The 
violations cited in this letter are not intended to be 
an all-inclusive statement of past or present violations that may 
exist in connection with the products you distribute. You are 
responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations 
and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other 
violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm 
complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations. 
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you 
an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this 
matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure 
and/or injunction. Please submit a written response to this letter 
within fifteen working days from the date of receipt, explaining 
the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. 
Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent 
the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related 
documentation. If you believe that the product you distribute is 
not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning 
and any supporting information for our consideration within fifteen working

D Chandler, AZ 85224-4708 United States United States WARNING LETTER 
December 13, 2022 


Dear Dr. Kottmer: From March 8, 2022, 
to March 18, 2022, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
investigator inspected your facility, Optum Infusion Services 308 LLC, located 
at 2555 West Fairview Street Suite 104 Building D, Chandler, 
Arizona 85224. During the inspection, the investigator noted serious deficiencies 
in your practices for producing drug products intended or expected 
to be sterile, which put patients at risk. FDA issued 
a Form FDA 483 to your firm on March 18, 
2022. FDA acknowledges receipt of your facility’s response, dated April 
8, 2022. Based on this inspection, it appears that you 
produced drug products that violate the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (FDCA). A. Compounded Drug Products Under the FDCA 
Section 503A of the FDCA describes the conditions under which 
human drug products compounded by a licensed pharmacist in a 
State licensed pharmacy or a Federal facility, or a licensed 
physician, qualify for exemptions from three sections of the FDCA: 
compliance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) (section 501(a)(2)(B)); labeling 
with adequate directions for use (section 502(f)(1)); and FDA approval 
prior to marketing (section 505) [21 U.S.C. §§ 351(a)(2)(B), 352(f)(1) 
and 355(a)]. B. Violations of the FDCA Adulterated Drug Products 
The FDA investigator noted that drug products intended or expected 
to be sterile were prepared, packed, or held under insanitary 
conditions, whereby they may have become contaminated with filth or 
rendered injurious to health, causing your drug products to be 
adulterated under section 501(a)(2)(A) of the FDCA. For example, the 
investigator observed that: 1. You did not perform adequate product 
evaluation and take appropriate corrective action after vermin was observed 
in your production area. Vermin are a source of microbial 
contamination. Therefore, your products intended to be sterile were produced 
in an environment that may not provide adequate protection against 
the risk of contamination. 2. You did not perform adequate 
product evaluation and take appropriate corrective action after microbial contamination 
was recovered within the ISO 5 aseptic processing area. 3. 
An operator placed their gloved hands outside the ISO 5 
area to retrieve supplies without sanitizing their gloved hands before 
re-entry into the ISO 5 hood. It is a prohibited 
act under section 301(k) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 
331(k)] to do any act with respect to a drug 
if such act is done while the drug is held 
for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in 
the drug being adulterated. C. Corrective Actions We have reviewed 
your firm’s responses to the Form FDA 483. Regarding your 
responses related to the insanitary conditions, some of your corrective 
actions appear adequate; however, we cannot fully evaluate the adequacy 
of the following corrective actions described in your response because 
you did not include sufficient information or supporting documentation: 1. 
In response to Observation 5 of the Form FDA 483, 
you stated that you changed pest control providers, installed insect 
light traps, and that you will be installing air curtains 
on exterior doors and plastic flap curtains inside of the 
warehouse door. It is unclear where the insect light traps, 
air curtains, or vortex curtains will be installed in relation 
to the classified areas. Additionally, it is unclear when these 
corrective actions will be fully implemented. 2. Regarding your response 
to Observation 1 of the FDA 483, we acknowledge your 
response indicating that you will update the way you assess 
and document the risk associated with every “patient compound” potentially 
affected by an excursion and train staff on the new 
policy. Also, you stated that you have conducted a retrospective 
review of “compounds” referenced in the observation and found there 
to be no product or patient impact. However, your response 
lacked supporting evidence, for example, you did not provide the 
retrospective review referenced. Furthermore, we acknowledge your response states, in 
SOP Compounded Sterile Product Impact Assessment Process, that a low 
risk level would be determined by the pharmacist in charge 
(PIC) based on the actionable microbial growth. Please note, any 
microbial contamination in the ISO 5 area is considered an 
insanitary condition. Additionally, your response states, in SOP Compounded Sterile 
Product Impact Assessment Process, that “(b)(4).” Please note, any microbial 
contamination within the ISO 5 area is a serious concern 
and upon recovery, your firm should immediately assess the impact 
on drug products produced. This assessment should include a thorough 
evaluation of how contamination could have entered this critical area, 
and over what period of time the contamination could have 
existed, as well as drug products that remain on the 
market that could be affected. 3. In response to Observation 
2 of the Form FDA 483, you stated that you 
provided on-site training to staff. However, you did not provide 
the attachment Aseptic Technique Evaluation Update 04072022 referenced in your 
response. Please be aware that section 501(a)(2)(A) of the FDCA 
concerning insanitary conditions applies regardless of whether drug products you 
compound meet the conditions of section 503A. FDA strongly recommends 
that your management undertake a comprehensive assessment of operations, including 
facility design, procedures, personnel, processes, maintenance, materials, and systems. In 
particular, this review should assess your aseptic processing operations. A 
third party consultant with relevant sterile drug processing expertise should 
assist you in conducting this comprehensive evaluation. D. Conclusion The 
violations cited in this letter are not intended to be 
an all-inclusive statement of violations at your facility. You are 
responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations 
and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other 
violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm 
complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations. 
You should take prompt action to address any violations. Failure 
to adequately address any violations may result in legal action 
without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. Within 
fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please 
notify this office in writing of the specific steps that 
you have taken to address any violations. Please include an 
explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence 
of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. This 
letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an 
opportunity to address them. If you believe your products are 
not in violation of the FDCA, include your reasoning and 
any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot completely 
address this matter within fifteen (15) working days, state the 
reason for the delay and the time in which you 
will do so. Send your electronic reply to ORAPHARM4_Responses@FDA.HHS.GOV or

United States United States WARNING LETTER September 23, 2022 


Dear 
Ms. Sedaghat: This is to advise you that the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at https://saffronusa.com in 
September 2022 and has determined that you take orders there 
for the products Allergy Blend, Chamomile Tea Petals, Diabetic Support 
Blend, Orange Blast Tea, and Saffron Loose Tea. The claims 
on your website establish that these products are drugs under 
section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for 
use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. 
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for 
introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. 
You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links 
on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. Examples of some of 
the website claims that provide evidence that your products are 
intended for use as drugs include: 1. Product: Allergy Blend 
On your product website https://saffronusa.com for Allergy Blend and under 
Health Benefits, your webpage shows: - Product name “Allergy Blend” 
- “A natural blend for Allergy relief” - “Upper respiratory 
tract infections” - “Coughs, Bronchitis” - “Asthma” 2. Product: Chamomile 
Tea Petals On your product website https://saffronusa.com for Chamomile Tea 
Petals under Health Benefits, your webpage shows: - “Treating diabetes” 
- “Slowing or preventing osteoporosis” - “Reducing inflammation” - “Cancer” 
- “[T]reating cold symptoms” 3. Product: Diabetic Support Blend On 
your product website https://saffronusa.com for Diabetic Support Blend and under 
Health Benefits, your webpage shows: - Product name “Diabetic Support 
Blend” - “A natural blend to help combat Diabetic” - 
“Have Cancer-Fighting Properties” - “Decrease Cholesterol Levels…” 4. Product: Orange 
Blast Tea On your product website https://saffronusa.com for Orange Blast 
Tea under Health Benefits, your webpage shows: - “Prevents skin 
damage.” - “Keeps blood pressure under check.” - “Lowers cholesterol.” 
- “Controls blood sugar level.” - “Lowers the risk of 
cancer.” 5. Product: “Saffron Loose Tea” On your product website 
https://saffronusa.com for Saffron Loose Tea under Health Benefits, your webpage 
shows: - “Fights Anxiety” - “Cancer prevention” - “Help insomnia” 
Your Allergy Blend, Chamomile Tea Petals, Diabetic Support Blend, Orange 
Blast Tea, and Saffron Loose Tea products are not generally 
recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses 
and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) 
of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not 
applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or 
delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from 
FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the 
Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug 
on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that 
the drug is safe and effective. A drug is misbranded 
under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if 
the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended 
use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a 
layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes 
for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, 
as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 
353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and 
under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Your Allergy Blend, 
Chamomile Tea Petals, Diabetic Support Blend, Orange Blast Tea, and 
Saffron Loose Tea products are intended for prevention or treatment 
of one or more diseases that are not amenable to 
self-diagnosis, prevention, or treatment without the supervision of a licensed 
practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for 
a layperson to use your products safely for their intended 
purposes. Accordingly, your Allergy Blend, Chamomile Tea Petals, Diabetic Support 
Blend, Orange Blast Tea, and Saffron Loose Tea products fail 
to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, 
the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act 
[21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into 
interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of 
the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)]. This letter is not intended 
to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist 
in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating 
and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing 
their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is 
your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all 
requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations. This letter notifies 
you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to 
address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result 
in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. Please 
notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt 
of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken 
to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step 
being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well 
as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective 
actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the 
delay and the time within which you will do so. 
If you believe that your products are not in violation 
of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information 
for our consideration. Your written response should be directed to 
the Food and Drug Administration, attention to: Mr. Ramon A. 
Hernández, District Director, 466 Fernández Juncos Avenue, San Juan, Puerto 
Rico 00901-3223. You may email a copy of your response 
with appropriate attachments to email address: orahafeast4firmresponses@fda.hhs.gov . Please ensure

32819 United States United States DATE: 12/21/2022 Case #: 630566 
WARNING LETTER Mr. Khoury: Your firm is registered as a 
human drug manufacturer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
conducted testing of a consumer antiseptic hand rub drug product 
(also referred to as a consumer hand sanitizer), labeled as 
Salon Technologies International Sanitizing Hand Spray 80%. Your firm also 
provided impurity test results for a consumer hand sanitizer, labeled 
as Antica Farmacista Hand Sanitizer Ocean Citron. These drug products 
were manufactured at your facility, Salon Technologies International, Inc., at 
8810 Commodity Circle, Suite 20, Orlando, FL, and distributed in 
the United States. The results of the FDA laboratory testing, 
and tests results provided by your firm, of batches of 
these products in U.S. distribution demonstrate that these drug products 
manufactured at your facility are adulterated within the meaning of 
section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act 
(FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B))1, in that contamination with unacceptable 
levels of impurities demonstrate that the quality assurance within your 
facility is not functioning in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing 
Practice (CGMP) requirements. Adulteration Violations Salon Technologies International Sanitizing Hand 
Spray 80% was manufactured at your facility. FDA laboratory testing 
of a batch of this product in U.S. distribution, found 
that the drug product contained impurities at unacceptable levels.1 Acetaldehyde 
and acetal impurities were found to be approximately 739 parts 
per million (ppm) and 988 ppm, respectively. Acetaldehyde and acetal 
are known impurities of alcohol, as delineated in the United 
States Pharmacopeia (USP). The USP monograph for alcohol limits acetaldehyde 
and acetal to not more than (NMT) 10uL/L, 10 ppm 
(expressed as acetaldehyde). Alcohol not meeting the specification for acetaldehyde 
and acetal is deemed adulterated under section 501(b) of the 
Act. Alcohol represents a significant component of your drug product; 
therefore, you must have a specification for acetaldehyde and acetal 
per 21 CFR 211.160(b). Further, finished product testing of each 
batch of drug product is required under 21 CFR 211.165. 
The test results for acetaldehyde and acetal impurities in your 
drug products are unacceptable because these results are higher than 
the levels expected if the alcohol contained in your products 
complied with compendial standards and if you had conducted finished 
product testing with a specification for acetaldehyde and acetal. Therefore, 
your drug products are deemed adulterated under section 501(a)(2)(B) of 
the FD&C Act. Acetaldehyde appears to be genotoxic, and potentially 
carcinogenic, when in direct contact with tissues. On June 24, 
2022, FDA sent you a letter informing you of the 
unacceptable levels of impurities2 in your Salon Technologies International Sanitizing 
Hand Spray 80% and requested additional information, including impurity testing 
of retain samples to determine the quality of all batches 
of hand sanitizer drug products distributed in the United States 
within expiry. On September 2, 2022, your firm provided impurity 
test results from retain samples, which included your Antica Farmacista 
Hand Sanitizer Ocean Citron drug product. Your test results for 
a batch of this drug product manufactured at your facility 
demonstrate that the drug product contained impurities at unacceptable levels. 
As reported by your firm, benzene impurity levels were found 
to be approximately 12 ppm. Manufacturers should not use benzene 
in the manufacture of drugs because it is a known 
human carcinogen that causes leukemia and other blood disorders. FDA 
has alerted all drug manufacturers to the known risk factors 
for contamination with benzene. For more information see https://www.fda.gov/drugs/pharmaceutical-quality-resources/fda-alerts-drug-manufacturers-risk-benzene-contamination-certain-drugs. On 
September 14, 2022, FDA held a teleconference with you. We 
recommended you consider removing the adulterated batches of Salon Technologies 
International Sanitizing Hand Spray 80% and Antica Farmacista Hand Sanitizer 
Ocean Citron currently in distribution from the U.S. market. On 
September 17, 2022, you issued a voluntary nationwide recall of 
one lot of your Salon Technologies International Sanitizing Hand Spray 
80% due to the presence of acetaldehyde and acetal impurities 
and one lot of your Antica Farmacista Hand Sanitizer Ocean 
Citron due to the presence of benzene impurities. Your firm 
failed to conduct impurity testing, including acetal, acetaldehyde, and benzene, 
of active pharmaceutical ingredients or for your finished hand sanitizer 
drug products prior to distribution. Because these impurities are a 
known risk of the manufacturing process, a finished product specification 
for these impurities in hand sanitizers is appropriate under 21 
CFR 211.160(b). Further, finished product testing of each batch of 
drug product is required under 21 CFR 211.165. The contamination 
with benzene, acetaldehyde, and acetal impurities in drug products manufactured 
in your facility, in addition to your failure to conduct 
impurity testing of your drug products prior to distribution, demonstrate 
that the quality assurance within your facility is not functioning 
in accordance with CGMP requirements under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the 
FD&C Act. On October 6, 2022, FDA notified the public 
of the unacceptable impurity results in your hand sanitizer drugs 
products at the following website: https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-consumers-should-not-use In response to this 
letter, provide: CGMP Consultant Recommended Based upon the nature of 
the violations we identified at your firm, you should engage 
a consultant qualified as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34 
to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements, if your 
firm intends to resume manufacturing drugs for the U.S. market. 
The qualified consultant should also perform a comprehensive audit of 
your entire operation for CGMP compliance and evaluate the completion 
and efficacy of any identified corrective actions and preventive actions 
before you pursue resolution of your firm’s compliance status with 
FDA. Conclusion The violations cited in this letter are not 
intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations associated with 
your drug products. You are responsible for investigating and determining 
the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence 
or the occurrence of other violations. Correct any violations promptly. 
Failure to promptly and adequately address this matter may result 
in regulatory or legal action without further notice including, without 
limitation, seizure, and injunction. Unresolved violations may also prevent other 
Federal agencies from awarding contracts. Failure to address violations may 
also cause FDA to withhold issuance of Export Certificates. FDA 
may withhold approval of new applications or supplements listing your 
firm as a drug manufacturer until any violations are completely 
addressed and we confirm your compliance with CGMP. We may 
inspect to verify that you have completed corrective actions to 
address any violations. If you decide you want to manufacture 
drugs for the United States in the future, request a 
Regulatory Meeting to discuss corrective actions. This letter notifies you

1 Due to an increased demand for alcohol-based hand sanitizers 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA published the Guidance for 
Industry: Temporary Policy for Preparation of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer 
Products During the Public Health Emergency (COVID-19) on March 19, 
2020, and subsequently updated the guidance several times. The guidance 
was withdrawn effective December 31, 2021 (86 Fed Reg at 
56960). This guidance communicated the agency’s temporary policy that we 
did not intend to take action against firms for CGMP 
violations under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act if such 
firms prepared alcohol-based hand sanitizers for consumer use (or for 
use as a health care personnel hand rub) during the 
public health emergency, provided certain circumstances described in the guidance 
are present. These circumstances included preparation of hand sanitizer products 
using only the ingredients and formulas set forth in the 
guidance. Because Salon Technologies LLC hand sanitizer drug products were 
not consistent with the formulations described in these guidances, they 
did not fall within any temporary agency policy not to 
take action against firms manufacturing hand sanitizer products for violations 
of section 505 of the FD&C Act. 2 In the 
June 24, 2022 letter, FDA had described “unacceptable” levels of 
acetal and acetaldehyde as being above 50 ppm. That number 
had originally been described in the Temporary Policy for Preparation 
of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the Public Health 
Emergency (COVID-19), and had represented FDA’s intent to not take 
action against products within that level of impurity, provided that 
the other circumstances described in the guidance were present. As 
noted in FN1 above, that temporary policy has been withdrawn, 
and accordingly acetal and acetaldehyde levels in alcohol must not 
exceed the 10 ppm limit prescribed by the USP. 02/07/2023

FL 33433-3453 United States United States WARNING LETTER November 17, 
2022 22-643090 


Dear Dr. Denker: The United States Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your firm, Mark 
S. Denker, M.D., PA dba Palm Beach Fertility Center, located 
at 7015 Beracasa Way, Suite 201, Boca Raton, FL, between 
May 31 and June 6, 2022. During the inspection, an 
FDA Investigator documented significant deviations from the regulations for human 
cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) set forth 
in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1271 
(21 CFR 1271) and issued under the authority of Section 
361 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. § 
264). The deviations documented on the Form FDA 483, List 
of Inspectional Observations (FDA 483), were presented to and discussed 
with you at the conclusion of the inspection. The items 
of concern include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1) Failure to determine as ineligible a donor who is 
identified as having a risk factor for, or clinical evidence 
of, any of the relevant communicable disease agents or diseases 
for which screening is required under 21 CFR 1271.75(a)(1) [21 
CFR 1271.75 (d)(1)]. For example: a. Directed semen donor (b)(6) 
answered “yes” to the question, “Have you had sex with 
another man in the preceding 5 years?” on the Donor 
Medical History Interview Form dated January 22, 2021. The donor 
was determined “eligible,” and semen was recovered on February 24, 
2021. b. Directed semen donor (b)(6) answered “yes” to the 
question, “Have you lived cumulatively for 5 years or more 
in Europe from 1980 until the present?” on the Donor 
Medical History Interview Form dated February 3, 2020 and November 
4, 2021. The donor was determined “eligible,” and semen was 
recovered on February 3, 2020, and November 5, 2021. 2) 
Failure to screen a donor of reproductive cells or tissue 
by reviewing the donor’s relevant medical records for risk factors 
for, and clinical evidence of, relevant communicable disease agents and 
diseases [21 CFR 1271.75(a)(1)]. Your Donor Medical History Interview Form 
is used as a relevant medical record to determine donor 
eligibility. However, the questionnaire is inadequate. For example, all donors 
who were screened using the Donor Medical History Interview Form 
between May 24, 2018, through March 16, 2022 (approximately (b)(4) 
anonymous oocyte donations, (b)(4) directed oocyte donations, and (b)(4) directed 
semen donations) were not screened for the following risk factors: 
a. Persons who have been treated for or had syphilis 
within the preceding 12 months. b. Persons who have tested 
positive or reactive for West Nile Virus (WNV) infection using 
an FDA-licensed or investigational WNV NAT screening test in the 
preceding 120 days. c. Persons who received any transfusion of 
blood or blood components in France between 1980 and the 
present. d. Your firm’s Donor Medical History Interview Form utilized 
between July 19, 2019 through March 16, 2022 failed to 
screen for persons who are current or former U.S. military 
members, civilian military employees, or dependents of a military member 
or civilian employee who resided at U.S. military bases in 
Northern Europe (Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands) for 6 months 
or more cumulatively from 1980 through 1990, or elsewhere in 
Europe (Greece, Turkey, Spain, Portugal, and Italy) for 6 months 
or more cumulatively from 1980 through 1996. 3) Failure to 
maintain documentation of the donor eligibility determination, including the name 
of the responsible person who made the determination and the 
date of the determination [21 CFR 1271.55(d)(1)(iii)]. For example, a 
review of records for all donors with recoveries between July 
19, 2019 and March 16, 2022 (approximately (b)(4) anonymous oocyte 
donations and (b)(4) directed semen donations) found that those records 
were missing the name of the responsible person who made 
the donor eligibility determination and the date of the determination. 
4) Failure of the summary of records, required under 1271.55(a)(3), 
to contain a listing and interpretation of the results of 
all communicable disease tests performed [21 CFR 1271.55(b)(2)]. For example, 
the test specimen collected from directed semen donor (b)(6) on 
January 29, 2021 was reported as “positive” for “CMV Total 
Antibody” on February 3, 2021. However, the summary of records 
for donor MB documents that the donor is negative for 
“Anti CMV Total Antibodies.” Semen was recovered from this donor 
on February 3, 2021. 5) Failure to include in the 
summary of records a statement noting the reason(s) for the 
determination of ineligibility in the case of an HCT/P from 
a donor who is ineligible based on screening and released 
under 21 CFR 1271.65(b) [21 CFR 1271.55(b)(4)]. For example: a. 
Directed semen donor (b)(6) was determined ineligible on May 1, 
2019. However, the Donor Eligibility Determination Form notes that the 
reasons for ineligibility are “high risk behavior” and “resides in 
Europe.” However, the Donor Medical History Interview Form for donor 
RP only documents that the donor has a high-risk behavior 
(sex with another male in the preceding five years). There 
is no documentation of the donor’s residence in Europe, therefore 
the reason(s) for ineligibility does not accurately reflect what is 
in the donor’s records. b. Directed semen donor (b)(6) was 
determined ineligible for semen recovery on February 3, 2021. However, 
the summary of records does not state the reason for 
the determination of ineligibility. c. Directed semen donor (b)(6) was 
determined ineligible for semen recovery on October 25, 2019. However, 
the summary of records does not state the reason for 
the determination of ineligibility. d. Directed semen donor (b)(6) was 
determined ineligible on May 16, 2019. However, the Donor Eligibility 
Determination Form notes the reason for ineligibility as, “Previous infection 
(Positive RPR) Pt treated (b)(6).” However, the test specimen collected 
from donor (b)(6) on May 8, 2019, tested reactive for 
RPR and reactive on a “Syphilis MHA-TP” test, which is 
a treponemal-based assay (confirmatory test). Therefore, the reason(s) for ineligibility 
does not accurately reflect that the donor had a current 
positive test for syphilis. 6) Failure to establish and maintain 
procedures for all steps performed in testing, screening, and determining 
donor eligibility, and complying with all other requirements of Subpart 
C “Donor Eligibility” in 21 CFR Part 1271.45-1271.90. “Establish and 
maintain” means define, document (in writing or electronically), and implement; 
then follow, review, and as needed, revise on an ongoing 
basis [21 CFR 1271.47(a)]. For example, your firm's procedures for 
testing anonymous and directed donors do not include HIV NAT, 
HBV NAT, HCV NAT, or West Nile Virus as required 
communicable disease tests. 7) Failure to establish and maintain a 
standard operating procedure governing the release of an HCT/P from 
a donor whose specimen tests reactive for evidence of infection 
due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) [21 CFR 1271.85(b)(2)]. For example, your 
procedures do not include how the CMV test results will 
be communicated to the physician responsible for accepting the HCT/P 
so that they may rely on the information to make 
informed decisions about the use of an HCT/P in a 
particular recipient’s situation. The deviations identified above are not intended 
to be an all-inclusive list of deficiencies at your facility. 
It is your responsibility to ensure that your establishment is 
in compliance with all applicable requirements of the federal regulations. 
You are responsible for reviewing your firm’s operations as a 
whole to ensure that you are in compliance with applicable 
FDA regulatory requirements. We acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 
June 24, 2022, which provides a response and corrective actions 
to FDA’s inspectional observations (FDA 483). We have reviewed the 
corrective actions outlined in the response and we have determined 
that the response is inadequate to address our concerns. A 
previous inspection of your facility conducted between May 10 and 
24, 2018, resulted in the issuance of an Untitled Letter 
dated November 16, 2018. To date, we have not received 
a response to the Untitled Letter delivered to your firm 
on November 27, 2018. However, in your June 12, 2018 
response to the FDA 483, you submitted a corrective action 
plan that committed to both immediate and preventive corrections such 
as revisions to procedures and forms, retraining of staff, and 
a commitment by the Medical Director to review donor records 
to ensure compliance prior to documenting a donor eligibility determination. 
Despite that commitment, the current inspection (May 31 through June 
6, 2022) documented many of the same violations, indicating that 
your corrective actions either were not implemented or were not 
effective to prevent the recurrence of the previously identified violations. 
The Agency continues to have serious concerns about your establishment’s 
ability to maintain compliance with 21 CFR Part 1271. Additionally, 
we have the following specific concerns and comments regarding your 
FDA 483 responses and your firm’s corrective actions. 1) In 
response to Observation 1, you provided an updated Donor Medical 
History Interview Questionnaire and stated that the missing questions were 
implemented in response to the March 16, 2022, FDA inspection 
of your sister facility in Aventura, FL. However, you previously 
stated in your June 12, 2018, response that your revised 
screening questionnaire was immediately implemented, yet the same risk factors 
were missing from your donor history questionnaire during the recent 
inspection that were missing during the 2018 inspection. Your June 
24, 2022, response does not address why this revised screening 
questionnaire was not implemented as promised. 2) In response to 
Observation 2, we acknowledge that you have revised your donor 
eligibility determination form; however, in your June 12, 2018, response, 
you stated the Medical Director would review all donor records 
and forms prior to final eligibility determination to ensure compliance. 
Despite this commitment, you continue to have deficiencies with your 
donor eligibility records. We are concerned about your ability to 
implement effective corrective actions to prevent the recurrence of the 
underlying problem pertaining to your firm’s failure to review all 
required documents prior to determining donor eligibility. 3) In response 
to Observation 3, you stated that you updated your donor 
summary of records form to incorporate the results from the 
physical exam and medical history interview in determining eligibility and 
provided training to your staff. However, we note that donor 
records from the current inspection and the 2018 inspection found 
documentation that donors answered “yes” to the question regarding having 
lived cumulatively for 5 years or more in Europe from 
1980 until the present, yet the donors were determined eligible. 
Additionally, your June 12, 2018, response stated you would, “Establish 
a process and procedure to ensure any donor who answers 
‘yes’ to having lived cumulatively for 5 years or more 
in Europe from 1980 until the present will be deemed 
ineligible.” We are concerned that this repeat observation shows that 
your 2018 commitment to review donor records prior to determining 
donor eligibility has not been effective. As required under 21 
CFR 1271.75(d)(1), you must determine to be ineligible, a donor 
who is identified as having a risk factor for, or 
clinical evidence of, any of the relevant communicable disease agents 
or diseases for which screening is required under Secs. 1271.75(a)(1), 
(b), or (c). As such, directed semen donors AH and 
GP should have been determined ineligible. Use of HCT/Ps from 
an ineligible donor is not prohibited in the case of 
a directed reproductive donor, provided the HCT/P from the donor 
is properly labeled with the appropriate warning labels, in accordance 
with 21 CFR 1271.65(b)(2). 4) In response to Observation 4, 
you stated that you have revised your summary of records 
form so that it documents only CMV total antibody to 
avoid confusion and provide clarity. We recommend that you review 
your donor records to confirm that semen donors who tested 
positive for CMV total antibody have these test results accurately 
reflected on the summary of records. Additionally, you do not 
have a written procedure that addresses how positive CMV test 
results will be communicated to the physician responsible for accepting 
the HCT/P so that they may rely on the information 
to make informed decisions about the use of an HCT/P 
in a particular recipient’s situation [21 CFR 1271.85(b)(2).] Refer to 
item 7 on this letter. 5) In response to Observation 
5, you stated that you updated your summary of records 
form to include the reason for ineligibility. However, this same 
observation was cited during the 2018 inspection of your establishment, 
and you committed to having the Medical Director review all 
records and forms prior to documenting the donor eligibility determination. 
Your previous corrective actions appear to have been ineffective to 
prevent recurrence of this deficiency. 6) In response to Observation 
6, your June 24, 2022, response states that your firm’s 
procedures were updated to include HIV NAT, HBV NAT, HCV 
NAT, and West Nile Virus as required donor screening tests. 
We note that your June 12, 2018, response also committed 
to updating your procedures to include this same missing testing 
requirement. However, our review of the selected pages you submitted 
with your June 24, 2022, response that document revisions to 
your HCT/Ps Procedure Manual noted that they still do not 
list HBV NAT as a required test for both anonymous 
and directed donors. In addition, our review of the submitted 
pages from your procedure found that they remain deficient for 
the reasons set forth below. Please note that this list 
is not necessarily all-inclusive, and it continues to be your 
responsibility to ensure that your establishment is in full compliance 
with 21 CFR Part 1271 at all times. a. The 
“Donor Testing” section of your procedure states for anonymous donors 
that, “A positive test to HBsAg may not make the 
donor ineligible.” In accordance with 21 CFR 1271.80(d)(1), a donor 
whose specimen tests reactive on a screening test for a 
communicable disease agent in accordance with Sec. 1271.85 must be 
determined to be ineligible. This applies to both anonymous and 
directed donors. b. The “Donor Testing” section of your procedure 
states for directed donors that positive results for the relevant 
communicable diseases listed, “…would require special labeling of HCT/P.” While 
special labeling is required for donors with positive testing for 
relevant communicable disease agents under 21 CFR 1271.65(b)(2), we note 
that your procedure does not require that directed donors with 
positive test results for a relevant communicable disease agent be 
determined ineligible. c. The “Donor Testing” section of your procedure 
states for directed donors that “A positive test to HBsAg 
may not require special labeling.” Under 21 CFR 1271.65(b)(2), you 
must prominently label with a biohazard legend and the applicable 
warning statement(s), an HCT/P made available for use from a 
directed reproductive donor who is determined ineligible due to a 
reactive screening test for a communicable disease agent, in accordance 
with Sec. 1271.80(d)(1). We recommend that you review your firm’s 
procedures and make the necessary changes to ensure they include 
all steps that you perform in testing, screening, determining donor 
eligibility, and complying with all other requirements in accordance with 
21 CFR 1271 of Subpart C-Donor Eligibility. Please note that 
if you still have oocytes and/or semen in storage from 
donors whose screening and/or testing was not completed in accordance 
with 21 CFR Part 1271, FDA considers the donor eligibility 
determinations to be incomplete for these donors. For example, this 
includes donors who failed to answer all screening questions on 
your donor history interview questionnaire. Therefore, as required by 21 
CFR 1271.60(a), you must keep these HCT/Ps in quarantine. Should 
the need arise in the future to remove any of 
these HCT/Ps from quarantine, either for use in your own 
establishment or for transport to another establishment, you may request 
an exemption or alternative from a requirement in subpart C, 
21 CFR Part 1271, as specified in 21 CFR 1271.155. 
Additional information can be found at: Exemptions and Alternatives | 
FDA. The email address for submissions is HCTPExemptions@fda.hhs.gov. Please note 
that 21 CFR 1271.155 requires that you provide justification for 
use of HCT/Ps from these donors, as well as information 
on how you have mitigated the risk consistent with the 
goals of protecting the public health and/or preventing the introduction, 
transmission, or spread of communicable diseases. Before any of these 
HCT/Ps can be removed from quarantine, the request must be 
granted by FDA. If you still have embryos in storage 
for which the donor eligibility requirements under 21 CFR Part 
1271, Subpart C are not met, please note that FDA 
considers the donor eligibility determinations to be incomplete for these 
donors. Therefore, as required by 21 CFR 1271.60(a), you must 
keep these HCT/Ps in quarantine. Should the need arise in 
the future to remove any of these HCT/Ps from quarantine, 
either for use in your own establishment or for transport 
to another establishment, you may release these HCT/Ps from quarantine 
[21 CFR 1271.90(b)] provided they are labeled in accordance with 
the applicable regulations at 21 CFR 1271.90(c). You should take 
prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter 
and prevent their recurrence. Failure to promptly correct these violations 
may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA 
without further notice. We request that you respond in writing 
within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this 
letter, outlining the specific steps you have taken or plan 
to take to correct the noted violations, including an explanation 
of how you plan to prevent these violations, or similar 
violations, from occurring again. Include any documentation necessary to show 
that correction has been achieved. If you cannot complete all 
corrective actions within fifteen (15) working days, please explain the 
reason for your delay and the timeframe within which the 
remaining corrections will be completed. Your response should be sent 
to Colleen M. Aspinwall, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food & Drug 
Administration, Office of Biological Products Operations – Division 1 at 
the email address: Colleen.Aspinwall@fda.hhs.gov. If you should have any questions, 
please contact Colleen Aspinwall at 561-416-1065, ext. 1105 or via

73127 United States United States WARNING LETTER December 13, 2022 
RE: 637182 


Dear Raymundo Osuna, The U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 
300 N. Macarthur Blvd, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, from June 7, 
2022, through June 13, 2022. Based on inspectional findings and 
a review of your product labels, we have identified serious 
violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the 
Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and 
FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page at 
www.fda.gov. We received your written response, dated July 5, 2022, 
to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you 
at the close of the inspection. We have reviewed that 
document and our comments are listed following each of the 
significant violations. Adulterated Dietary Supplements The inspection of your facility 
revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good 
Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations 
for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). Based on the 
inspection, we determined that your products, including your (b)(4), and 
(b)(4) products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) 
of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they 
have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do 
not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. The significant violations 
documented during the inspection include, but are not limited to 
the following: 1. You failed to establish product specifications for 
the identity and purity of the finished batch of the 
dietary supplement as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you 
told our investigator that you have created finished product specifications 
for your (b)(4) and (b)(4) products; however, these specifications fail 
to include established specifications for the identity and purity of 
each of the products. We acknowledge your response, which states, 
“Raw materials and finished product shall be tested for identity, 
purity, or composition as stated in the revised SOP…The Quality 
Department will be working with the labs to establish specifications 
for identity, purity, and composition for finished products.” However, we 
are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action 
because you did not provide finished product specifications for our 
review. 2. You failed to prepare and follow a written 
master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of dietary 
supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to 
ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, 
as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). Specifically, you provided MMRs 
for the (b)(4) and (b)(4). You also provided batch production 
records (BPR) for two lots of (b)(4) and two lots 
of (b)(4). With the exception of one lot of the 
(b)(4), none of the BPRs matched the MMRs for the 
products. As such, the BPRs do not support that you 
are preparing and following written MMRs for each unique formulation 
and batch size of dietary supplement that you manufacture. In 
preparing the MMRs, they must include the required elements of 
21 CFR 111.210. We reviewed your response in which you 
state, “Quality Supplement Manufacturing will have the SOP revised and 
implement the new process in place within the next 90 
days.” We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your 
corrective action because you did not provide any MMRs for 
any manufactured dietary supplement for our review. 3. You failed 
to verify, for a subset of finished dietary supplement batches 
that you identify through a sound statistical sampling plan (or 
for every finished batch), that your finished batch of the 
dietary supplement meets product specifications for identity, purity, strength, and 
composition, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c). Specifically, your firm’s 
BPRs for the (b)(4) (lots (b)(4) and (b)(4)) and (b)(4) 
(lots (b)(4) and (b)(4)) indicate that the supplement products contain 
multiple dietary ingredients; however, during inspection, you stated that you 
verify the strength for only one dietary ingredient in each 
of the dietary supplements. Selecting only one of multiple dietary 
ingredients in the supplement products does not verify your production 
and process control system is producing a dietary supplement that 
meets the required product specifications for identity, purity, strength, and 
composition of the dietary supplement. We reviewed your response in 
which you state, “Quality Supplement Manufacturing will have the SOP 
revised and implement the new process in place within the 
next 90 days.” We are unable to evaluate the adequacy 
of your corrective action because you did not provide any 
standard operating procedures for review. 4. You failed to ensure 
all tests and examinations that are used to determine whether 
a specification is met are appropriate and scientifically valid in 
accordance with 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1). Specifically, you stated “the only 
analysis for the finished product is by input and a 
(b)(4) test.” The input of the various dietary ingredients during 
production and subsequent analysis of a single dietary ingredient alone 
in the finished product is not sufficient to verify specifications 
for identity, purity, strength, and composition in a finished product 
because inputting specific amounts of various ingredients during manufacturing does 
not ensure that specifications are met in the finished product, 
nor does later testing for a single dietary ingredient assess 
any other components within the finished product. 5. Your quality 
control personnel did not reject a component and dietary supplement 
for which a specification was not met, as required by 
21 CFR 111.77(a), nor did they approve a treatment, an 
in-process adjustment, or reprocessing that would ensure the quality of 
the finished dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement would 
be packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR. You 
have in-process specifications within your MMR for fill weights of 
capsules and tablets to ensure that the finished product meets 
the label declarations. In several instances, your product neither met 
these specifications nor were they approved for an appropriate treatment, 
in-process adjustment, or reprocessing. For example: o The tablet run 
sheet for (b)(4) (lot (b)(4)) includes out of specification fill 
weights. The BPR states the fill weight range is (b)(4) 
mg. The tablet run sheet has weights throughout in the 
(b)(4) range and notes “tablet won’t hit the weight so 
running (b)(4).” A corrective action approved by the firm’s quality 
unit was not documented. o The capsule run sheet for 
(b)(4) (lot (b)(4)) includes out of specification fill weights. The 
BPR states the fill weight range as (b)(4) mg. The 
QC capsule run sheet has fill weights listed at (b)(4) 
mg, (b)(4) mg, (b)(4) mg and (b)(4) mg. There are 
several notes that adjustments are being made but no corrective 
action approved by the firm’s quality unit addresses the underweight 
capsules. We have reviewed your written response in which you 
state that the root cause for the out of specification 
fill weights for your (b)(4) product was “lack of training” 
and that you would be “revising your sample run process” 
along with “[a] new SOP…to explain the sample run process 
and how to run deviations.” We are unable to evaluate 
the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not 
provide any training records for review, new SOPs, or other 
documentation on your new sample run or deviation process. 6. 
Your quality control personnel failed to reject the component, dietary 
supplement, package, or label, when a specification established in accordance 
with 21 CFR 111.70 is not met, nor did they 
approve a permitted treatment, an in-process adjustment, or reprocessing, as 
required by 21 CFR 111.113(b)(2). For example, your finished product 
test for your (b)(4)(lot (b)(4)) includes strength analysis for the 
dietary ingredient (b)(4). The product specification for the ingredient in 
the supplement products is (b)(4) mg/tablet. An out of specification 
result of (b)(4) mg/tablet was reported by your contract lab 
(b)(4). A corrective action approved by the firm’s quality unit 
was not documented. We have reviewed your written response in 
which you state that “[the] Quality Department will be signing 
off on all finished product test results.” We are unable 
to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you 
did not provide any test result records or other documentation 
to show the implementation of the new procedure. 7. Your 
quality control operations for the MMR, the BPR, and manufacturing 
operations failed to include approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as 
required by 21 CFR 111.123(a)(5). For example, (b)(4) barrels of 
(b)(4) tablets (lot (b)(4)) were returned to the blending stage 
for grinding; however, the BPR does not include documentation showing 
that your quality control operations approved or rejected any reprocessing. 
8. Your quality control failed to document in the BPR 
at the time of performance the approval and release, or 
the rejection of a batch of dietary supplement for distribution, 
as required by 21 CFR 111.260(l)(3). For example, BPRs for 
(b)(4) (lot (b)(4) and (b)(4)) do not include documentation that 
your quality control personnel approved and released, or rejected, the 
batches for distribution.Misbranded Dietary Supplements In addition, even if your 
(b)(4) product was not an unapproved new and misbranded drug, 
this product and others would be misbranded under section 403 
of the Act because it does not comply with the 
labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following: 
1. Your (b)(4) and (b)(4) dietary supplement products are misbranded 
under section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] 
in that the presentation of nutrition information on the labeling 
for your products does not comply with the labeling requirements 
for dietary supplements in 21 CFR 101.36. For example, o 
Your (b)(4) Facts label fails to declare the source of 
the (b)(4). (21 CFR 101.36(d)) o Your (b)(4) Facts label 
incorrectly declares as a (b)(2)-dietary ingredient, “(b)(4)”. 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) 
lists an RDI for (b)(4) of (b)(4) mcg based on 
the AI (adequate intake) that pertains only to (b)(4). (b)(4) 
should be listed as a (b)(3)-dietary ingredient. o Your (b)(4) 
product fails to declare the source of the (b)(4) as 
indicated in the master manufacturing record; e.g., (b)(4) (as (b)(4)). 
(21 CFR 101.36(d)) o Your (b)(4) fails to express the 
metric quantitative amounts by weight per serving of other dietary 
ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii)(A); for example, (b)(4) 
mg should be (b)(4)g. o Your (b)(4) fails to declare 
the quantitative amount of (b)(4) with the % Daily Value 
based upon the presence of (b)(4) in the product formula, 
as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) 2. Your (b)(4) product 
is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(w)(2) of the 
Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(2)], in that the finished product 
labels fail to declare the major food allergen, shrimp and 
crab, as required by section 403(w)(1) of the Act. Specifically, 
as you have chosen to use a “Contains” statement, you 
must declare the specific type of Crustacean shellfish. 3. Your 
(b)(4) product and (b)(4) products are each misbranded within the 
meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 
343(i)(2)] in that each product label fails to declare the 
common or usual names of each ingredient used as required 
by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically, o 
Your (b)(4) Facts label declares the (b)(4) but fails to 
state the standardized common name “(b)(4)” as listed in the 
reference Herbs of Commerce, as incorporated by 21 CFR 101.4(h). 
o Your (b)(4) product’s ingredient list declares “flavorless coating (Yellow 
5, Red 40, Blue 1)” which is not the common 
or usual name of an ingredient. Furthermore, your batch production 
records for the product indicate “(b)(4)” as an ingredient but 
this ingredient does not appear in the ingredient list of 
your product label. o Your (b)(4) Facts label declares the 
(b)(4) but fails to state the standardized common name “(b)(4)” 
as listed in Herbs of Commerce. [See 21 CFR 101.4(h)] 
Furthermore, the source ingredient (b)(4) fails to be listed first 
within the parentheses, and then followed by the (b)(4) name 
within parentheses; for example, (b)(4) 4. Your (b)(4) product label 
is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the 
Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(y)] in that the label fails 
to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through 
which the responsible person (as described in section 761 of 
the Act) may receive a report of a serious adverse 
event with such dietary supplement. This letter is not intended 
to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist 
at your facility or in connection with your products. You 
are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any 
violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of 
other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your 
firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA 
regulations. This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides 
you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address 
this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, 
seizure and injunction. Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 
working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific 
steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an 
explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence 
of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If 
you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state 
the reason for the delay and the time within which 
you will do so. If you believe that your products 
are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning 
and any supporting information for our consideration. Your response should 
be sent to Dana Lewis, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration at the following email: dana.lewis@fda.hhs.gov (preferred), or you

Coyol, Edificio B33 El Coyol De Alajuela, Alajuela 20101 Costa 
Rica United States WARNING LETTER September 30, 2022 


Dear Charlie 
Noel: During an inspection of your firm located in Alajuela, 
Costa Rica, on May 23, 2022, through May 26, 2022, 
an investigator from the United States Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) determined that your firm manufactures Headway Microcatheter, LVIS, LVIS 
Jr, Scepter C and XC Occlusion Balloon Catheter, SOFIA Catheters, 
and BOBBY Balloon Guide Catheter. Under section 201(h) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. 
§ 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended 
for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions 
or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, 
or to affect the structure or any function of the 
body. This inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within 
the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 
§ 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the 
facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or 
installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing 
practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 
21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. We received 
responses from Scafford Serron, Ph.D., VP of Global Quality dated 
June 16, 2022, July 18, 2022, and August 18, 2022, 
concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483 
(FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations, which was issued to 
your firm. We address this response below, in relation to 
each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are 
not limited to, the following: 1. Failure to verify a 
process that cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and 
test with a high degree of assurance and approved according 
to established procedures. The validation activities and results, including the 
date and signature of the individual(s) approving the validation and 
where appropriate the major equipment validated, shall be documented, as 
required by 21 CFR 820.75(a) – Process Validation. For example: 
a. The catheter wash limitation process justifications (b)(4) dated October 
31,2018 and (b)(4) dated June 10, 2021, do not specify 
the requirements for the catheter wash process validation prior to 
conducting the process validation. Additionally, the justifications provided for several 
test parameters do not provide a high degree of assurance 
and were not approved according to established procedures. Prior to 
the 2018 validation, this process had not been validated according 
to established procedures. Therefore, it is unknown if the catheter 
wash process sufficiently removes foreign material from the manufacturing process. 
The responses dated June 16, 2022, July 18, 2022, and 
August 18, 2022 are not adequate. Your firm initiated CAPA(b)(4) 
to address Observation 1 and identified four root causes and 
training corrective actions, and conducted a retrospective review of processes 
requiring validation. Documents gathered at the inspection, “(b)(4)” (b)(4) and 
(b)(4), and provided in the response, “(b)(4)” (b)(4) require biocompatibility 
testing comply with ISO 10993-1. However, CAPA(b)(4) does not provide 
a high degree of assurance, as addressed in the FDA-recognized 
standard ISO-10993 [Biocompatibility]. For example: i) Per Part 1 of 
ISO-10993, a gap analysis and selection of biological endpoints for 
assessment is necessary to assess the biological safety of the 
medical device. The proposed responses and corrective actions do not 
address all biological endpoints, including pyrogenicity. ii) Per Part 5 
of ISO-10993, cytotoxicity testing standards require that the cytotoxicity be 
addressed at 24 hours and 48 hours, and that the 
results after 48 hours be less than or equal to 
Grade 2 by quantitative methods. The proposed responses and corrective 
actions incorrectly state the acceptance criteria to be, “Non cytotoxicity 
response with a test score of ≤2 at 24-Hour observation.” 
iii) The validation process and corrective actions fail to address 
the residual sterilant levels after the changed catheter wash procedure 
and device sterilization. Per ISO 10993-7, “A valid method of 
extraction and measurement shall be used to determine the amount 
of EO and, where necessary, ECH delivered to the patient.” 
iv) The proposed corrective actions do not address design transfer 
for the software validation functionality testing, in which there is 
failure to ensure that the device design is correctly translated 
into production specifications, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(h). b. 
It cannot be verified from the non-equipment software test report: 
coating tracker software (b)(4) that the tasks requiring a specific 
number of repeats for validation were conducted for the required 
number of repeats per the protocol. The responses dated June 
16, 2022, July 18, 2022, and August 18, 2022 indicate 
that the root cause investigation is completed, additional review of 
all other previously completed non-equipment software production pertaining to the 
hydrophilic coating process were identified and are being implemented, and 
corrective actions are ongoing under CAPA(b)(4). The adequacy of the 
responses cannot be determined until the outstanding inadequacies with CAPA(b)(4) 
under Observation 01 are addressed. 2. Failure to establish and 
maintain adequate procedures for implementing and maintaining corrective and preventive 
actions, as required by 21 CFR 820.100. For example: a. 
Your firm’s Supplier Corrective Action Request (SCAR) Process (b)(4) requires 
that the firm open a SCAR “when it is determined 
that a supplier corrective action is need for an NCR” 
(Nonconformance Report). The FDA investigator collected examples of nonconformance reported 
quality problems where no SCAR was opened by your firm 
as required by its procedure. Additionally, because these corrective actions 
were taken as a result of these nonconformances outside of 
your firm’s corrective action procedures, no evaluation as to whether 
actions taken adversely affected the finished device was completed, nor 
were the corrections verified as effective, as required by 21 
CFR 820.100(a)(4). The responses dated June 16, 2022, July 18, 
2022, and August 18, 2022 are not adequate. Your firm 
initiated CAPA(b)(4) to address Observation 5 and identified five root 
causes. Your firm updated its procedure, (b)(4) to provide clarification 
to its employees as to when a SCAR needs to 
be initiated. Your firm submitted documentation that supports training of 
its employees on the new procedure. Your firm states that 
it will ensure each corrective and preventive action is effective 
through the Verification of Effectiveness process, though it is not 
clear exactly how and when that will occur. Your firm 
initiated a 3-year retrospective review of supplier NCR events where 
SCARs were not initiated and plans to evaluate any adverse 
effects of these NCRs as part of the CAPA underway. 
This activity is scheduled to be completed at the end 
of October 2022. The adequacy of your firm’s responses will 
be evaluated after you submit clarification of your plan to 
ensure effectiveness of the implemented corrective actions and documentation to 
support that effectiveness when complete. b. Your firm’s CAPA system 
fails to identify “rejects” as nonconforming product and therefore misses 
all nonconforming product during the manufacturing process as a quality 
data input for the CAPA system, as required by 21 
CFR820.100(a)(1). Without nonconforming product as a quality data input to 
the CAPA system, the ability to detect recurring quality problems 
is greatly diminished. The responses dated June 16, 2022, July 
18, 2022, and August 18, 2022 are not adequate. Your 
firm stated that its Quality Reporting procedure does require your 
firm to periodically review rejected material and that its employees 
“could” request a CAPA if they decided to based on 
that review. Your firm updated its CAPA procedure (b)(4) to 
include Reject data/trend for consistent wording between its other relevant 
SOPs for Quality Reporting to be more clear that rejected 
material needs to be investigated as nonconforming product and that 
data needs to be fed into the CAPA system. Your 
firm stated that it has “made employees aware” and that 
effectiveness checks are planned to be completed by February 2023. 
It is not clear whether your firm has evaluated whether 
the periodic reviews of the rejected material historically have warranted 
an investigation. Information is needed to clarify whether a retrospective 
review has been completed or is planned. 3. Failure to 
adequately establish and maintain procedures to control product that does 
not conform to specified requirements. The procedures shall address the 
identification, documentation, evaluation, segregation, and disposition of nonconforming product. The 
evaluation of nonconformance shall include a determination of the need 
for an investigation and notification of the persons or organizations 
responsible for the nonconformance. The evaluation and any investigation shall 
be documented, as required by 21 CFR 820.90(a). For example: 
During production and quality inspection, nonconforming product is identified as 
a “reject”. While rejected/nonconforming product is identified, documented, and segregated, 
the firm is not evaluating the nonconformance to determine the 
need for an investigation and notification of persons or organizations 
responsible for the nonconformance, as required by 21 CFR 820.90(a). 
The responses dated June 16, 2022, July 18, 2022, and 
August 18, 2022 are not adequate. Your firm made initial 
corrections to several procedures and definitions to ensure that rejected 
nonconforming product during the manufacturing process is accurately captured, trended, 
and fed into its CAPA system. Part of the issue 
related to a high reject rate was due to material 
that was destroyed during testing being labeled as “reject” in 
addition to actual nonconforming product. Your firm implemented an IT 
solution to label those samples separately as “destroyed” instead of 
“reject”. Your firm states that it has notified its relevant 
employees of the definition and procedure change. Your firm states 
that it plans to conduct effectiveness checks for CAPA (b)(4) 
and included the planned evaluation and timeframe for doing so, 
with a completion date of February 2023. Your firm also 
mentions a “preventive” action that plans to look at other 
product lines and systems where “reject” is used as a 
product designation to ensure that they are not missing any 
other nonconforming product documentation. It is not clear whether this 
includes a retrospective review of previous rejected materials in an 
attempt to determine whether an investigation needs to be opened 
into those nonconforming product. The adequacy of your firm’s responses 
will be evaluated after you provide information clarifying whether a 
retrospective review of rejected product will occur to determine whether 
an investigation can or should be done at this time. 
Other federal agencies may take your compliance with the FD&C 
Act and its implementing regulations into account when considering the 
award of federal contracts. Additionally, should FDA determine that you 
have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to 
premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will 
not be approved until the violations have been addressed. Please 
notify this office in writing, within fifteen business days from 
the date you receive this letter, of the specific steps 
your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as 
well as an explanation of how your firm plans to 
prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include 
documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address 
systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm's 
planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please 
include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections 
and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, 
state the reason for the delay and the time within 
which these activities will be completed. Please provide a translation 
of documentation not in English to facilitate our review. We 
will notify you regarding the adequacy of your firm’s response 
and the need to re-inspect your firm’s facility to verify 
that the appropriate corrections and/or corrective actions have been made. 
If you believe that your products are not in violation 
of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting 
information for our consideration as part of your response. Your 
firm's response should be sent to CDRHWarningLetterResponses@fda.hhs.gov, or if e-mail

The specific violations noted in this letter and in the 
Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the 
inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm's

States WARNING LETTER CMS #644680 December 27, 2022 


Dear Mr. 
Hiller: During an inspection of your firm located in Tuttlingen, 
Nendingen, Germany on July 18, 2022 through July 21, 2022, 
an investigator from the United States Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) determined that your firm manufactures Monopolar Laparoscopic Instruments with 
disposable and reusable instrument tips. Under section 201(h) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. 
§ 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended 
for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions 
or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, 
or to affect the structure or function of the body. 
This inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the 
meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 
351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities 
or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation 
are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice 
requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. We received a 
response from Florian Herb, QMR dated August 8, 2022 concerning 
our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 
483), List of Inspectional Observations, which was issued to your 
firm. We received an additional response dated October 27, 2022 
which is currently under review. We address the August 8, 
2022 response below, in relation to each of the noted 
violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 1. Failure to establish and maintain design history file 
(DHF) for each of the products that GH manufactures, as 
required by 21 CFR 820.30(j). For example: your firm has 
not established a Design History File (DHF) for its line 
of Class II Monopolar Laparoscopic Instruments with reusable instrument tips, 
exported and intended for the US market. We reviewed your 
firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate. CDRH 
acknowledges that your firm’s response states the firm corrective actions 
are planned for revising, Procedure, (b)(4) Development, which will describe 
a DHF and what a retrospective DHF looks like. While 
your response indicated the firm has voluntarily blocked the products 
from shipment to the United States after the July inspection, 
it is not clear that your risk assessment is adequate, 
because your response did not address evaluation of the risks 
for devices already distributed in the US (e.g., Health Hazard 
Evaluation) or any potential subsequent efforts for correction and removal. 
2. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for acceptance of 
incoming product as required by 21 CFR 820.80(b). For example: 
during the inspection on July 20, 2022, of your firm’s 
CNC Department, the investigator identified multiple raw materials that according 
to staff had not gone through your firm’s incoming acceptance 
process, but which had been labeled with your (b)(4) system 
generated inventory sticker and staged next to approved raw materials 
also labeled with your (b)(4) inventory sticker. Per your firm’s 
staff, the (b)(4) inventory sticker identifies approved raw materials, and 
these raw materials are used in the manufacturing of medical 
devices by your firm, however they were not properly identified 
to ensure that only product which has passed the required 
acceptance activities are distributed or used. We reviewed your firm’s 
response and concluded that it is not adequate. CDRH acknowledges 
that your firm’s response states your firm’s corrective actions include 
applying missing markings for quarantine stock areas in the company, 
creating/implementing procedures for product identification and training employees. However, your 
response does not mention a plan to analyze existing records 
to determine whether there is a risk that the inappropriately 
received raw material impacted in-process or finished device specifications and 
to determine the risk that nonconforming product was released for 
distribution (including actions to be taken to mitigate such risks). 
Our inspection also revealed the Monopolar Laparoscopic Instruments are adulterated 
under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), 
because your firm does not have an approved application for 
premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of 
the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application 
for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of 
the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g) for the device. The 
Monopolar Laparoscopic Instruments are also misbranded under section 502(o) of 
the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm introduced 
or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution 
this device with significant changes or modifications that require a 
premarket notification to FDA under section 510(k) of the Act, 
21 U.S.C. § 360(k), and 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3). Specifically, these 
devices were cleared under K171523 as “Monopolar Single Use Laparoscopic 
Instrument.” The 510(k) Summary for K171523 includes, in part, the 
following Device Description (emphasis added): The Monopolar Single Use Laparoscopic 
Instruments of Getsch + Hiller is available in two different 
designs. It is available as system consisting of two parts 
and as a system consisting of four parts. The 2-part 
system is available with reusable handle assembled with a completely 
insulated shaft on which only a single use tip has 
to be fixed by the user. This has a working 
length of 330 mm. The 4-part system consists of a 
reusable handle and a reusable shaft insulated, a connection rod 
with easy snap lock and a single use tip. The 
system has to be assembled by the user. The 4-part 
system is available with a working length of 330 mm 
and 450 mm. Different types of single use tips are 
offered for both systems, Maryland grasping forceps, Endoclinch grasping forceps, 
Aggressive grasping forceps and Johan grasping forceps. Furthermore, Metzenbaum scissors 
in different sizes, straight or curved, are available. However, your 
firm is manufacturing reusable tip inserts. Your instructions for use 
describe cleaning and sterilization procedures for these inserts and state, 
“50 reprocessing cycles can be performed for the inserts and 
‘inserts fixed to the shaft.’” The Laparoscopy Catalog notes about 
“Detachable Instruments” that, “For sterilizing purposes, the instruments may be 
detached into 2-parts (3 mm instruments) or 3-parts (3,5/5/10 mm 
instruments) of components. All items are compatible with each other 
and can be sterilized easily.” These use descriptions go significantly 
beyond the clearance in K171523 and provide evidence that device 
components that were cleared for single use are now intended 
for multiple use following reprocessing. Such a change from single 
use tips to reusable tips constitutes a change or modification 
in the device that could significantly affect the safety or 
effectiveness of the device, for which your firm lacks clearance 
or approval. For a device requiring premarket approval, the notification 
required by section 510(k) is deemed satisfied when a PMA 
is pending before the agency. 21 CFR 807.81(b). The kind 
of information that your firm needs to submit in order 
to obtain approval or clearance for the device is described 
on the Internet at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance/how-study-and-market-your-device. The FDA will evaluate the 
information that your firm submits and decide whether the product 
may be legally marketed. Other federal agencies may take your 
compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations into 
account when considering the award of federal contracts. Additionally, should 
FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that 
are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III 
devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations 
have been addressed. Please notify this office in writing within 
fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter 
of the specific steps your firm has taken to address 
the noted violations, including an explanation of how your firm 
plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring 
again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which 
must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If 
your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over 
time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. 
If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen 
business days, state the reason for the delay and the 
time within which these activities will be completed. Please provide 
a translation of documentation not in English to facilitate our 
review. If you believe that your products are not in 
violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any 
supporting information for our consideration as part of your response. 
Your firm’s response should be sent by email to CDRHWarningLetterResponses@fda.hhs.gov

you have any questions about the contents of this letter, 
please contact: Colin Kejing Chen, Ph.D. at 301-796-6390. Finally, you 
should know that this letter is not intended to be 
an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility. 
It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted 
in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, 
issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic 
of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management 
systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of 
any violations and take prompt actions to address any violations 
and bring the products into compliance.

Dear 
Mr. Smucker: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services Food Safety 
Branch (CHFS-FSB) jointly inspected your manufacturing facility located at 767 
Winchester Road, Lexington, KY 40505-3728 from May 19, 2022, through 
June 9, 2022. The inspection was initiated as part of 
a multistate foodborne outbreak investigation of Salmonella Senftenberg (S. Senftenberg) 
illnesses linked to your ready-to-eat (RTE) peanut butter. According to 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 21 people 
from 17 states were infected with the outbreak strain of 
S. Senftenberg. On May 20, 2022, your firm recalled all 
peanut butter manufactured at this facility from October 1, 2021, 
to May 20, 2022, due to potential contamination with Salmonella. 
CDC and FDA have determined, based upon the epidemiologic, laboratory, 
and traceback evidence, that peanut butter manufactured at your facility 
was the source of this multistate S. Senftenberg outbreak. Further, 
the evidence establishes that you introduced adulterated peanut butter into 
interstate commerce as prohibited by section 301(a) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 
331(a)]. During the joint inspection, FDA and CHFS-FSB investigators found 
serious violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, 
and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP & 
PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 
(21 CFR Part 117). Based on our inspectional findings, we 
have determined that the RTE peanut butter manufactured in your 
facility is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of 
the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)], in that it was 
prepared, packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may 
have been contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health. 
In addition, failure of the owner, operator, or agent in 
charge of a covered facility to comply with the preventive 
controls provisions of the CGMP & PC rule (located in 
Subparts A, C, D, E, F, and G of Part 
117) is prohibited by section 301(uu) of the Act [21 
U.S.C. § 331(uu)]. You may find the Act and further 
information about the CGMP & PC rule through links in 
FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov. At the conclusion of the 
inspection, FDA (hereinafter, we) issued a Form FDA 483 (FDA 
483), Inspectional Observations. We received your responses to the FDA 
483 dated July 1, 2022, August 1, 2022, August 16, 
2022, and October 4, 2022, describing the corrective actions taken 
and planned by your firm, including training records associated with 
your implemented corrective actions. After reviewing the inspectional findings and 
your responses, we are issuing this letter to advise you 
of FDA’s continuing concerns and provide detailed information describing the 
findings at your facility. Multistate Outbreak of Salmonella Senftenberg linked 
to Jif Brand Peanut Butter: During routine monitoring of the 
whole genome sequencing (WGS) National Center for Bioinformatics database, FDA 
identified five recent 2022 clinical isolates (samples collected from ill 
people) which matched over one hundred third-party peanut butter and 
environmental isolates from Kentucky collected from 2014 to 2017. Shortly 
thereafter, FDA and CDC began investigating a multistate outbreak of 
Salmonella infections. On May 19, 2022, five out of five 
patients who were interviewed, reported peanut butter exposure with four 
specifically reporting consuming Jif brand peanut butter. FDA reviewed information 
from inspections and identified a 2010 FDA environmental sample of 
S. Senftenberg collected from your facility. WGS was conducted on 
the 2010 environmental sample, and it was found to match 
the growing cluster of S. Senftenberg clinical isolates from the 
outbreak of Salmonella infections and the peanut butter and environmental 
isolates from Kentucky. The presence of the same S. Senftenberg 
strain in your facility since 2010, which matched the clinical 
cluster, is indicative of a resident strain. On May 19, 
2022, we notified you of these findings via teleconference. On 
May 20, 2022, you initiated a voluntary recall of Jif 
brand peanut butter. In addition, CDC deployed a supplemental peanut 
butter focused questionnaire to identify possible clinical exposures. In total, 
this outbreak included 21 cases from 17 states. Of 13 
cases with information, all reported Jif brand peanut butter exposure 
(100%). Epidemiological, laboratory and traceback data show that you introduced 
adulterated peanut butter into interstate commerce as prohibited by section 
301(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)). Specifically, the 
evidence supports that the peanut butter responsible for this outbreak 
was manufactured in your Lexington, KY facility. Your finished product 
testing records from January 1, 2021, to February 23, 2022, 
indicate that you detected Salmonella in your RTE peanut butter 
on numerous occasions, i.e., October 22 and December 15, 2021; 
and February 4, 9, 10, 20, and 21, 2022, and 
that your corrective actions were not sufficient to address the 
root cause of the contamination. For example, on February 17-18, 
2022, you identified a leak in the air intake vent 
of the cooling chamber of Roaster (b)(4), as a source 
of water entering your equipment, and stated you immediately repaired 
the vent. However, on February 20, 2022, after the repair 
was completed, you detected Salmonella in (b)(4) of the (b)(4) 
lots on Line (b)(4) ((b)(4), and (b)(4)) using your standard 
(b)(4) samples per lot sampling program. Subsequently, per your practice, 
you “collect[ed] [and tested] (b)(4) samples ((b)(4) sample composites) from 
the lot[s] produced immediately prior to and after the product 
that tested positive.” After testing (b)(4) lots that initially tested 
negative for Salmonella, you identified two additional positive lots: The 
next day, on February 21, 2022, you detected Salmonella in 
a (b)(4) lot on Line (b)(4) using your standard (b)(4) 
samples per lot sampling program. Similar to February 20, after 
testing (b)(4) lots that initially tested negative for Salmonella you 
identified additional positive lots: You indicated that “[e]ven when the 
additional samples test negative, we destroy all (b)(4) production lots 
to provide further assurance we have bracketed and eliminated any 
potential contamination.” However, your positive test results for lots for 
which Salmonella was previously not detected show the limitations of 
reliance on your testing program to identify contamination as a 
way to prevent contaminated products from reaching consumers. Further, the 
S. Senftenberg outbreak shows that neither your corrective actions nor 
your finished product testing was adequate to prevent contaminated product 
from reaching consumers and causing illnesses. In your letter dated 
May 27, 2022, you stated that the outbreak of S. 
Senftenberg was likely due in part to Salmonella introduced to 
your production process through cooling air supply vents that were 
installed incorrectly on Roaster (b)(4) on December 10, 2021, allowing 
unfiltered air and a small amount of rainwater to enter 
the cooling section of the roaster where the peanuts are 
RTE. Preventing water in dry processing environments for low moisture 
foods is essential to control environmental pathogens such as Salmonella. 
In your response dated July 1, 2022, you stated that 
you updated your finished product testing procedures to include a 
“(b)(4) Hold” in the event a single positive result is 
detected in your RTE peanut butter. This (b)(4) Hold includes 
holding “(b)(4) Lots” produced (b)(4) hours before and (b)(4) hours 
after the affected (i.e., positive) lot and performing further testing 
using (b)(4) samples from only the (b)(4) lots on “each 
extreme of the bracketed window” (i.e., only the (b)(4) or 
(b)(4) lot on either end of the held product). You 
stated that “this conservative approach provides a safety factor to 
ensure any potential contamination is included [in the held product].” 
We are concerned that your use of this approach in 
response to a contamination event would not ensure all affected 
product would be identified and prevented from entering commerce. We 
are not aware of any data or scientific rationale to 
support how your (b)(4) Hold would be an effective approach 
to identify all product affected by a contamination event in 
your continuous production of RTE peanut butter. As part of 
your response to this letter, we ask that you provide 
support for your approach. Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls 
(21 CFR Part 117, Subpart C): 1. You did not 
identify and evaluate the hazard of contamination with environmental pathogens, 
such as Salmonella spp. at certain post-roasting processing steps, as 
a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard to determine whether it 
requires a preventive control, to comply with 21 CFR 117.130(c)(1)(ii). 
Specifically, your hazard analysis, “Hazard Analysis – Process for the 
‘Jif Lexington’” plant, dated March 2022, for your RTE peanut 
butter, did not consider the hazard of recontamination with environmental 
pathogens, such as Salmonella spp., at post-roasting processing steps from 
blanching to sorting and milling (including (b)(4)). In-process RTE peanuts 
are exposed to the environment at these steps, and the 
food does not receive further treatment or otherwise include a 
control measure (such as a formulation lethal to the pathogen) 
that would significantly minimize the pathogen. Your July 1, 2022, 
response discussed actions your facility has taken to address the 
deficiencies with your food safety plan, including adding environmental recontamination 
with Salmonella as a hazard requiring a sanitation preventive control 
at all steps where RTE product is exposed to the 
environment and will not receive an additional kill-step. However, you 
did not provide a revised hazard analysis or food safety 
plan for our evaluation. As part of your response to 
this letter, we request that you provide your current food 
safety plan (including your hazard analysis). 2. Your corrective action 
procedures did not ensure appropriate action was taken, when necessary, 
to reduce the likelihood that environmental contamination will recur, as 
required by 21 CFR 117.150(a)(2)(ii), when you detected Salmonella in 
your facility’s environment. During FDA’s February 2018 inspection, you indicated 
that your environmental monitoring program included collecting (b)(4) environmental samples 
from zones (b)(4), and (b)(4) located throughout the manufacturing and 
packaging areas of the facility. All samples were sent to 
your third-party testing laboratory and analyzed for Listeria monocytogenes, E. 
coli, and Salmonella. You stated that your corrective actions for 
positive samples included increased cleaning and sanitizing to the subject 
area until (b)(4) negatives are obtained. Your environmental monitoring records 
from July 24, 2018, November 26, 2018, October 9, 2019, 
and November 4, 2019, revealed four Salmonella positive environmental swabs 
located at roaster (b)(4), stairs leading to platform “(b)(4)”, floor 
of the entrance to the blanch nut tank rooms (b)(4) 
and (b)(4), and the floor broom in the roaster (b)(4). 
You determined that the root causes for each Salmonella positive 
environmental swab were roof leaks or increased foot traffic during 
repairs in response to roof leaks, and you took immediate 
action to repair roof leaks and to correct foot traffic 
issues. Your records indicate that you suspended production until you 
could clean and sanitize the areas and take other corrective 
actions, such as adding (b)(4) and replacing utensils, as appropriate. 
Your environmental monitoring records from 2021 revealed five Salmonella positive 
environmental swabs in your facility on July 6, July 8, 
July 12, September 3, and November 16, 2021. These Salmonella 
positive swabs were found on the floors near your blanch 
nut tank rooms, roaster booth (b)(4), the stairs at the 
top level of the nut house (b)(4), and the stairs 
leading to platform “(b)(4)”. The detection of Salmonella in your 
facility in 5 locations in 2021, many of which were 
similar to locations where you detected Salmonella in 2018 and 
2019, show that your corrective action procedures in response to 
environmental contamination in 2018 and 2019 were not sufficient to 
reduce the likelihood that environmental contamination would recur, as required 
by 21 CFR 117.150(a)(2)(ii). In your response dated July 1, 
2022, you indicated that you conducted root cause investigations on 
the 2021 Salmonella findings in your facility, and you implemented 
corrective actions consistent with your environmental monitoring procedures. However, the 
outcomes of these investigations (e.g., your root cause determinations) were 
not provided in your response. This letter is not intended 
to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist 
in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating 
and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing 
their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is 
your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all 
requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations. This letter notifies 
you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to 
address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result 
in legal action including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction. In 
addition, we have the following comments: We are concerned that 
the history of contamination events associated with water in your 
facility and results from the WGS database suggest that Salmonella 
may be resident within your production facility. As an example 
of the continuing problems with water in the facility, we 
note that on February 17-18, 2022, you found a puddle 
of water, measuring approximately 4 feet by 8 feet in 
the bottom of cooling zone (b)(4) in Roaster (b)(4) and 
a puddle of water measuring approximately 4 inches by 4 
inches in the bottom of cooling zone (b)(4) in Roaster 
(b)(4). After you found the puddles of water, you collected 
environmental swabs from Roaster (b)(4), which were found to be 
indicative of microbial growth. Your investigation found a defective flange 
on the zone (b)(4) cooler inlet of Roaster (b)(4), which 
allowed rainwater and unfiltered air to enter the roaster’s cooling 
zones and contact the roasted peanuts after the roasting/kill step. 
Your corrective actions included repairing the defective flange and cleaning 
and sanitizing the roasters. In your July 1, 2022 response, 
you stated that you will verify that there are no 
conditions conducive for bacteria growth on equipment due to the 
presence of water/moisture before beginning a production run. Specifically, you 
provided your “Right to Run (b)(4) Inspection” procedure which you 
state is a supplement to the overall Plant Food Safety 
program to ensure the plant does not continue production with 
critical food safety risks present (i.e., “external conducive conditions related 
to water penetration and other adverse environmental factors that could 
yield product contamination”). You also implemented (b)(4) inspections and sanitation 
of the roofs and ceilings according to your Master Sanitation 
Schedule. While these procedures may help to identify events which 
would introduce water into your processing environment, constant vigilance is 
needed to ensure water does not become a source or 
route of cross-contamination in your dry processing environment. Further, to 
prevent Salmonella from spreading in your facility and adulterating your 
products, it is essential to identify the areas in your 
food manufacturing plant where Salmonella survive and take corrective actions 
as necessary to eradicate the organism. In addition, we recommend 
that you consider incorporating WGS as a tool to investigate 
pathogen isolates obtained in your environmental monitoring program and/or your 
finished product testing program. The use of WGS to analyze 
and investigate any pathogen isolated from your production environment or 
RTE peanut butter will provide the most complete information available 
to identify and implement appropriate and effective corrective actions, including 
steps to prevent the contamination from recurring and steps to 
ensure contaminated product does not enter commerce. Furthermore, we note 
that during the inspection and in your response dated July 
1, 2022, you stated that on “very rare instances you 
find Salmonella in finished product when a Salmonella organism survives 
our validated thermal process.” Specifically, you stated this in reference 
to the detection of Salmonella in your peanut butter produced 
on October 22, 2021, and December 15, 2021. You added 
that you have a “robust finished product testing program specifically 
because of this possibility, as even a validated kill step, 
such as the roasters that are validated to deliver over 
a (b)(4) kill, does not eliminate the potential that Salmonella 
could survive the roasting process on rare occasion.” We evaluated 
your roasting process parameters during the inspection and disagree with 
your position that a properly validated and implemented process control 
at your peanut roasting step would allow for the survival 
of Salmonella such that the pathogen would be detected in 
your finished product because it survived the roasting step. In 
addition, you stated in your July 1, 2022, response that 
after detecting Salmonella in your RTE peanut butter on February 
4, 9, and 10, 2022, you used a (b)(4) to 
remove peanut butter from the lines between the (b)(4) to 
the (b)(4). (b)(4) piping and other equipment used to process 
peanut butter contaminated with Salmonella, although effective at removing large 
amounts of peanut butter from the equipment, are not an 
effective means of eliminating possible Salmonella contamination from that equipment. 
Please respond in writing, within 15 working days of receipt 
of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken 
to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step 
being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well 
as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective 
actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the 
delay and the time within which you will do so. 
If you believe that your products are not in violation 
of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information 
for our consideration. Your written response should be sent to

Dear Mr. Sui-Rong Tan: On June 21 and 
22, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration conducted a Foreign 
Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of AMO and Wing Inc. 
dba T and H Trading Co. located at 968 89th

May 18, 2021. These inspections were conducted to determine compliance 
with the requirements of section 805 of the Federal Food, 
Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and 
the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) part 1, subpart L. The FSVP regulation requires that 
importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or 
animal food they import into the United States has been 
produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety 
standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP regulation 
and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links 
in FDA’s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals. During the most 
recent inspection, we found that you are not in compliance 
with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart L 
for the foods you import. Because of these significant violations, 
you are not in compliance with section 805 of the 
FD&C Act. At the conclusion of the inspection, our investigator 
provided you with a Form FDA 483a, FSVP Observations. We 
acknowledge receipt of your response to the Form FDA 483a, 
FSVP Observations dated July 1, 2022, in which you stated 
that you are “qualified to declare as a small importer” 
and provided documents that support your “import sales” were less 
than $1 million per year between 2019 and 2021. We 
understand your response to mean that you may meet the 
definition of a very small importer (VSI) under 21 CFR 
1.500, based on your statements to our investigator during the 
inspection that you planned to document such. In your response 
you also requested for an extension of thirty (30) days 
to obtain letters of assurance from your foreign suppliers. As 
of the date of this letter, we have not received 
your written assurances from your foreign suppliers. With respect to 
your documentation of import sales, we note that per 21 
CFR 1.500, very small importer means: With respect to the 
importation of human food, an importer (including any subsidiaries and 
affiliates) averaging less than $1 million per year, adjusted for 
inflation, during the 3-year period preceding the applicable calendar year, 
in sales of human food combined with the U.S. market 
value of human food imported, manufactured, processed, packed, or held 
without sale (e.g., imported for a fee). Your significant violations 
of the FSVP regulation are as follows: As a very 
small importer, for each food you import, you must obtain 
written assurance, in accordance with 21 CFR 1.512(b)(3), before importing 
the food and at least every two years thereafter, that 
your foreign supplier is producing the food in compliance with 
processes and procedures that provide at least the same level 
of public health protection as those required under section 418 
or 419 of the FD&C Act, if either is applicable, 
and the implementing regulations, and is producing the food in 
compliance with sections 402 and 403(w) (if applicable) of the 
FD&C Act. Specifically, you did not provide written assurances from 
your foreign suppliers for any of the foods you import, 
including dried noodle and dried bean curd from (b)(4); and 
vermicelli from (b)(4). The above violations are not intended to 
be an all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. 
It is your responsibility to ensure that you are in 
compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act and the 
implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L. This 
letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an 
opportunity to address them. If you do not adequately address 
this matter, we may take further action. For instance, we 
may take action under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the food you 
import for which you appear to be in violation of 
section 805. We may place the foods you import into 
the United States on detention without physical examination (DWPE) when 
you import the foods. You can find DWPE information relating 
to FSVP in Import Alert #99-41 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, 
the importation or offering for importation into the United States 
of an article of food without the importer having an 
FSVP that meets the requirements of section 805 of the 
FD&C Act or the FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 
301(zz) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(zz)). You should 
respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your 
receipt of this letter. Your response should address the specific 
things you are doing to correct any violations. You should 
include in your response documentation and information that would assist 
us in evaluating your corrections, (e.g., documentation of changes you 
made, such as a copy of your FSVP, records to 
demonstrate implementation of your FSVP), and any additional information that 
you wish to supply relevant to your compliance with the 
FSVP regulation. If you believe that you are not in 
violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any 
supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete all 
corrections within fifteen (15) working days, you should explain the 
reason for your delay and state when you will correct 
any remaining violations. Please send your reply to Food and

Dear Mr. Hermilo Salazar: On June 23 - July 
7, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a 
Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of HST Produce, Inc. 
located at 4310 Oates Rd, Houston, TX 77013-3336. We also 
conducted an inspection on October 19 - October 20, 2020. 
These inspections were conducted to determine your compliance with the 
requirements of section 805 of the Federal Food, Drug and 
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing 
FSVP regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L. The 
FSVP regulation requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities to 
verify that human and/or animal food they import into the

are not in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 
part 1, subpart L for the foods you import. Because 
of these significant violations, you are not in compliance with 
section 805 of the FD&C Act. At the conclusion of 
the most recent inspection, our investigator provided you with a 
Form FDA 483a FSVP Observations. We have not received your 
response to the FDA 483a issued to you at the 
close of the inspection on July 7, 2022. Your significant 
violations of the FSVP regulation are as follows: You did 
not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by 
section 805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 
1.502(a). Specifically, your firm did not develop, maintain, and follow 
an FSVP for any foods that you import, including each 
of the following foods: You import fresh produce, that is 
“covered produce” as defined in 21 CFR 112.3. As an 
importer of covered produce, you must have an FSVP that 
demonstrates that your supplier is producing the food in compliance 
with processes and procedures that provide at least the same 
level of public health protection as those required under section 
419 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 350h) (regarding 
standards for produce safety) and the implementing regulations in the 
Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce 
for Human Consumption (21 CFR part 112). The above violations 
are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations 
of the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure 
that you are in compliance with section 805 of the 
FD&C Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part

United States United States Warning Letter February 6th, 2023 RE: 
WL 2474 


Dear Mr. Sickelton: The United States Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your firm’s drug registration and 
listing information provided to FDA’s electronic Drug Registration and Listing 
System (eDRLS) for your drug product, The Body Bean’s Hand 
Sanitizer - Scented. Our review revealed that you are manufacturing 
a hand sanitizer for U.S. commercial distribution for which you 
have not registered your establishment and listed your drug product 
with the FDA. As such, your firm is in violation 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) 
as explained below. We note that FDA previously sent you 
and your firm a letter on this same subject, on 
October 21, 2022, notifying you of your failure to register 
your establishment and list your drug product. Even after such 
notice, the registration and listing data have not been submitted 
to the agency. Under section 510(j) of the FD&C Act, 
and 21 CFR Part 207.17(a) and 21 CFR 207.41(a) of 
FDA regulations, with some limited exceptions, firms that manufacture, prepare, 
propagate, compound, or process drugs in the United States or 
that are offered for import into the United States must 
be registered with the FDA (21 U.S.C. 360(b), (c), (d), 
and (i)). Every person who is required to register must, 
at the time of initial registration, list all drugs manufactured, 
prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed for commercial distribution (21 U.S.C. 
360(j)(1)). You have failed to fulfill your establishment registration obligations 
as required under section 510 of the FD&C Act, which 
is prohibited under section 301(p), 21 U.S.C 360 and 331(p). 
In addition, your firm, The Body Bean, LLC, failed to 
fulfill its listing obligations under section 510(j) of the FD&C 
Act, which is a prohibited act under section 301(p), 21 
U.S.C. 360(j) and 331(p). Failure to properly list a drug 
with FDA also renders it misbranded under section 502(o) of 
the FD&C Act, and in violation of section 301(a) of 
the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(o) and 331(a). As a 
result, the drug, The Body Bean’s Hand Sanitizer - Scented, 
is misbranded under section 502(o) of the FD&C Act, 21 
U.S.C. 352(o). Complete, accurate, and up-to-date establishment registration and drug 
listing information is essential to promote and protect patient safety. 
FDA relies on establishment registration and drug listing information for 
several key programs, including drug establishment inspections, supply chain security, 
and post-market surveillance. Drug registration and listing information is also 
widely used outside FDA for purposes such as electronic prescribing 
and electronic health records, insurance reimbursement, and patient education. We 
note that this warning letter only addresses registration and listing 
issues associated with your products. It is not intended to 
be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in 
connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and 
determining the causes of any violations and for preventing recurrence 
or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility 
to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of 
federal law, including FDA regulations. This letter notifies you of 
our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. 
Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal 
action including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction. Please notify FDA 
in writing, within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of 
this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to 
address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being 
taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as 
copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions 
within fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for the 
delay and the time within which you will do so. 
If you believe that your products are not in violation 
of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting 
information for our consideration. Your response should be sent to 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and 
Research/Office of Compliance/Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance by 
e-mail to edrls@fda.hhs.gov. Please be aware that a manual override 
may be required for certain types of revisions made to 
an existing drug listing file. If you receive a validation 
error or have any questions regarding the contents of this

55025 United States United States February 2, 2023 WARNING LETTER 



Dear Mr. Weidenhamer and Mr. Morin: The Center for Tobacco 
Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has 
reviewed your submissions to the FDA and our inspection records, 
and determined that Liquivape manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for 
commercial distribution in the United States, and that the e-liquid 
products are manufactured and offered for sale or distribution to 
customers in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 
§ 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are 
made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. 
Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA 
jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 387a(b)). Therefore, these products are required to be in 
compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act. Please be 
aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products 
meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories to 
these newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation under 
the FD&C Act. These products include, but are not limited 
to, electronic nicotine delivery systems (including e-cigarettes and e-liquids), cigars, 
and pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To 
Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 
as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control 
Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products 
and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 
28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. The FD&C Act 
requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization in 
effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that 
was not commercially marketed in the United States as of 
February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was 
commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the 
FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization 
order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless 
(1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under 
section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) 
and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent 
to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C 
Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 
905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and 
all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of 
substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)). New Tobacco Products Without 
Required Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded FDA has determined 
that you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to customers in the 
United States Gummi Bearz e-liquid products without a marketing authorization 
order. The tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products 
because they were not commercially marketed in the United States 
as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have 
FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of 
the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the 
marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 
902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In 
addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other 
information respecting these products were not provided as required by 
section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. The doing of any 
act with respect to a tobacco product while such article 
is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which 
results in such product being adulterated or misbranded is a 
prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, to the extent that a report 
was required under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, the 
failure to provide such report is a prohibited act under 
section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)). 
Conclusion and Requested Actions All new tobacco products on the 
market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully 
and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion. Products 
for which no application is pending, including, for example, those 
with a Marketing Denial Order and those for which no 
application was submitted, are among our highest enforcement priorities. For 
information on how FDA intends to prioritize enforcement resources with 
regard to the marketing of certain adulterated and misbranded ENDS 
and other deemed new tobacco products, please refer to the 
FDA’s guidance titled Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems 
(ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the Market Without Premarket 
Authorization, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market. It is your responsibility to ensure 
that all of your tobacco products comply with each applicable 
provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure 
to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 
§ 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products 
including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, 
and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not 
limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this 
Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of 
section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco 
products offered for import into the United States that appear 
to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused 
admission. The violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily 
constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to 
address any violations that are referenced above, as well as 
violations that are the same as or similar to the 
ones stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring 
your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act. Please 
submit a written response to this letter within 15 working 
days from the date of receipt describing your actions to 
address any violations and bring your products into compliance, including 
the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or 
distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining 
compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that your 
products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include 
your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This 
letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with 
an opportunity to address them. You can find the FD&C 
Act through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov. Please note

Dear Mr. 
Frost: The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions to the 
FDA and our inspection records, and determined that Switch to 
Vapor manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for commercial distribution in 
the United States, and that the e-liquid products are manufactured 
and offered for sale or distribution to customers in the 
United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug,

that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) 
of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a 
marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco 
product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a 
report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product 
substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of 
the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report 
under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the 
requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) 
of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).New Tobacco Products 
Without Required Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded FDA has 
determined that you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to customers in 
the United States KATY PEARY e-liquid products without a marketing 
authorization order. The tobacco products listed above are new tobacco 
products because they were not commercially marketed in the United 
States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not 
have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) 
of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from 
the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under 
section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). 
In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or 
other information respecting these products was not provided as required 
by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. The doing of 
any act with respect to a tobacco product while such 
article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce 
which results in such product being adulterated or misbranded is 
a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, to the extent that a 
report was required under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, 
the failure to provide such report is a prohibited act 
under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
331(p)).§ 331(p)). Conclusion and Requested Actions All new tobacco products 
on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are 
marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s 
discretion. Products for which no application is pending, including, for 
example, those with a Marketing Denial Order and those for 
which no application was submitted, are among our highest enforcement 
priorities. For information on how FDA intends to prioritize enforcement 
resources with regard to the marketing of certain adulterated and 
misbranded ENDS and other deemed new tobacco products, please refer 
to the FDA’s guidance titled Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine 
Delivery Systems (ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the Market 
Without Premarket Authorization, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market. It is your responsibility 
to ensure that all of your tobacco products comply with 
each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing 
regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 
21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to 
tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 
1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, 
but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. 
However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for 
purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note 
that tobacco products offered for import into the United States 
that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained 
or refused admission. The violations discussed in this letter do 
not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt 
action to address any violations that are referenced above, as 
well as violations that are the same as or similar 
to the ones stated above, and take any necessary actions 
to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C 
Act. Please submit a written response to this letter within 
15 working days from the date of receipt describing your 
actions to address any violations and bring your products into 
compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative 
sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan 
for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe 
that your products are not in violation of the FD&C 
Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our 
consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides 
you with an opportunity to address them. You can find 
the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov.
