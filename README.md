# FDA Database Search Engine 
This program is a search platform that allows lawyers (or other interested parties) to easily get descriptive statistics regarding FDA warning letters and inspections. The program stops short of generating a 'risk level', but it is our hope that it can be used by attorneys to have more concrete evidence when presenting information about possible risks to clients. 


## Running The Code
To run the code complete the following steps: 
In terminal (with zsh activated) type the following to activate the virtual environment: 
```zsh
source virt/bin/activate
```

Following that, run the following command from the Law-Innovation parent Directory: 
``` zsh 
python3 app.py 
```

Lastly, once the program is up and running, acccess the website using the [link it provides](127.0.0.1:5000/)


_Note if in a different shell such as fish or bash , the command to activvate virtual environemt the might be different_
